"karl, thank you for this video bro. it was an awesome insight into the various parts and culture of pakistan. i leave for my month of travelling pakistan in a few weeks, helped on by you and this incredible film. cheers mate!",english,,
"breath taking and beautiful! gilgit is disputed land and so is kashmir. both are under the un resolution awaiting referendum. but looks like pakistan maintains high security to safeguard locals n tourists, unlike the neighbor. people are people, its only love. people stare because there is very little in their space. some commented about the religious school, but probably that is all that they have, the state is bankrupt to run schools and children drop out of schools at high rate in this state. so dont be quick to point finger but read more to know more. school offers discipline to young mind be conventional or of a religious designation. lets be kind to each other especially children. hunza people are healthiest in this world. i am glad pakistan has taken good care of the region. nothing industrial built, topography maintained and people look to be at peace.people are commenting about kids marketing the kalma.... at least there are no violent mobs like happens in india where they force minority to say jai shree ram.yogi is setting up up summer hindu schools, how does that sound? perspectives!",english,,
