In 2017 I was 16 and had the opportunity go from Portugal to S√£o Tom√© and Principe and let me tell you, it was incredible. My first time leaving the European continent and nothing like I ÃÅve seen before. Everyone is lovely, the food is amazing and the views are what you just saw... from another world. I will never forget this amazing trip and watching this video made me nostalgic. Hopefully I can come back when Valbon becomes president :D Loved, loved this video! Leve, leve!",

Your heart beats for something far greater than yourself. In your hands, we see the possibility of a new dawn for S√£o Tom√©, a future built not upon power, but upon love, compassion, and the deep belief that each person can make a difference.\n\nThe true essence of leadership is not in the title one holds, but in the ability to listen, to understand, and to uplift those who need it most.

The power you seek is not of dominance, but of unity, the power to bring people together with kindness and wisdom.\n\nI believe in your vision, Valbon.

You have the gift of seeing the world not just as it is, but as it could be‚Äîand in that vision lies the future of not only your country but of us all.

Not only did you guys remind to put my phone down a little bit more but you made me remember that amazing feeling of showing kindness to anyone even if you don't know them. I don't know if anybody will ever see this but after watching this video I am now looking into going to somewhere in Africa to help out with humanitarian aid and just help the people less fortunate than us. It was so amazing seeing the generosity/compassion and the love from these people that it sparked something in me again to just want to go help everyone as much as I can. these people deserve the world with the love and kindness they show to everyone no matter who they are. I envy this kind of community and care about one another beyond belief. Thank you so much and god bless all of you guys for what you do.

Those breathtaking scenic view, green forest, blue water, mountainous road, beautiful beaches all were simply mind blowing. That Valbon dude is really awesome. He is really something special. Well mannered, polite and patient. He came from nowhere and joined the journey, exchanged so many beautiful words and smile. He is so positive and an inspirational person who will inspire so many to be a good guy like him. He will do extraordinary things for his country if he gets the chance. I hope someday he will be the president of his country.",
