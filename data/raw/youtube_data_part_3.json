      "It makes me so sad that despite having so much wealth, people in slums are forced to live in such terrible conditions. If I were a billionaire, I would dedicate my money to making sure people had healthy living conditions. Even after investing in fixing slums, the rich would still have more than enough wealth left. How can they turn a blind eye, knowing the kind of money they have? It makes me wonder if they even have a heart to care for the poor or if their ego feels bigger by looking down on them. The way some of these rich people in India ignore the suffering around them is just sick.",

Having recently returned from India I am shocked by the total and absolute  indifference of wealthy Indians to the most awful of poverty of fellow citizens. Delhi and Mumbai are total shit holes and any future improvements will only be for the benefit of the wealthy, and ring-fenced exclusion of the embarrassing poor by forced displacement is to be anticipated. I am very sorry for the poor who seem to be stoic in their acceptance of the mind bending distopic conditions. Delhi is buried under a mountain of plastic and rubbish and excrement and the air pollution is literally almost off scale. Anywhere else there would be riots and insurrection. The people are so accepting and friendly and willing. None of the popular deities worshiped  appear to give a shit either.🤔 As usual the poorest are pedalled lies about divine protection or indeed   Divine interest in them and their welfare.\n\nPoverty remains deeply entrenched in India.",

      "I'm super impressed by the taxi drives or these cities. I mean, I have travelled a few cities in India and I'd confirm that the Auto and Taxi drivers are the best to give you information and not only directions but even more.\n\nAll of them come from humble lifestyles and a few would be studying or applying for some kinda govt. jobs, so they have a lot of knowledge about a lot of things. And they aren't always stuck into their phones so they know what's happening in their surroundings.\n\nThey bring fact to reality that \"Language isn't a barrier of knowledge\". They have political and economical understandings, facts and view points of the country.\n\nThe taxi driver / guide - Mr. Khan, Kudos! for being the guy who you are. This purely shows how humble and nice Indians are rest assured knowledgeable. He had a smile and did his job and beyond. Many comments said \"cute broken English\", and as true as it was everyone understood what he said and he didn't shy aways from speaking and sharing more, and for that I'm sure people across the world watching this video would feel how warm Indians are if you genuinely want to know us. \n\nEven the random taxi guy outside Palladium mall associated Indira Gandhi to Italy;  I'm sure if you get a youtuber out on the streets asking the richer and so called educated youth this particular question, they wouldn't know it.\n\nMr. Khan, I hope to travel in your cab someday, I'd definitely buy you a tea and love to talk to you.",

In fact my father was manager at The Taj Mahal Hotel in the 1950s where he met Mr Ramanathan, President of Singapore between 1999-2011, who was previously (1982) chairman of The Straits Times.  At that time Mr Ramanathan was not well known and he was visiting Bombay in a personal capacity.  So my father took him around Bombay and they became close friends.  \nI had also gone to St Don Bosco School in Matunga, where the church is covered with beautiful marble imported from Italy.  I believe it was Fr. Aurelius Maschio who helped build that beautiful church.",

Yes there is poverty there but there is also so much more going on in Dharavi.

Even the auto driver in your this vlog have fours kids right? It’s a law of nature that anything that is available in abandon are valueless so the labour fees are very low in countries were there is overpopulated. If I’m wrong then you can check these flowing countries Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, Nepal, Philippine etc. So the Ultimate SOLUTION to ERASE poverty in Asian and African poor countries is just to CONTROL OVERPOPULATION. 🙏🙏✌️✌️",

And the US is getting more like India with thousands living on the streets in American cities.  I'd be interested to know who is funding all the construction? I assume it is speculators  so one wonders when the bubble will burst.  I assume that the tax structure in India is similar to the US where the rich pay the least and everyone else pays more.",

      "I haven't been to India since 1996. I was a woman alone, traveling with a backpack and Lonely Planet Guidebook, and the changes I've seen via videos such as yours are really amazing. One thing that strikes me since then is the growth of wealth in that country. It looks like some of it has trickled down and a more prosperous middle class is rising. What shocked me the most about India was all the homeless living on the streets, making cardboard shelters by rivers in the countryside and everywhere they weren't driven off. I didn't realize I was seeing a preview of what's now becoming a familiar sight in America -- homeless people everywhere. The economy has shifted again towards places with lots of excess people who will work in factories for pennies, relocating wealth once again. I'd go back if I could, but NOT alone and with a backpack at my age of 75.",

Before getting to know about your channel, i really had a wish to be a traveller who travel the places and live with the natives and follow their way of living with them for a while. And fortunately I found you doing the same, at first I was surprised that how my thought/idea/wish was not unique, I thought I would be the first one doing this, but then I saw you, omg you're doing the same and in a veryyyy muchhhh interesting way. Whenever I want to escape from the hustle of life through my mobile only, I check out your channel if any new video is there or not. Your videos are so perfect, peaceful and pyaari. Lots of love and a great health to you to keep travelling and let us travel through our phones. ☺️♥️",

But Really, you are doing a great job—always keep exploring like this.”",

      "\"Harshil\" you seriously gave me what I never had. I never knew about you, you were introduced as a place to me, when my lifetime blessing took me to you (being dead honest) I was mesmerized by your beauty, your people and mostly your fresh air. Stayed up 4 days but you made me feel like I already was an old resident. Whatever I asked you, you showed me\n• Breathtaking snowpeaks\n• Lively views\n• Warm sun (at about -5 degrees)\n• Cold rains\n• Even my first snowfall\n\nI promise I'll never consider you as a place anytime!! Everytime I watch the memories, everything takes me back to the moment I lived, I loved and I laughed at. Thank you for my lifetime blessing for taking me to my dream which I never knew I wanted to see.🙏🏻♥️",

Not only the place is serene but the place gets its unique richness through its people. The way they treat you; the values are priceless. See that bridge made of wood by cutting minimal mountain to ease the route. No greed in their eyes. Got it that people who deserve nature serve nature.❤❤\nYour work is undescribable; leaves me stunned with those perfect shots and the background music is cherry on the top..!✨\nI literally love your videos. Would say it's my one of the most favourite thing to do. Wish to visit such places soon. You are delivering life to some nature lovers who are currently not able to visit nature in such depth!\nThank you for all your efforts!!✨❤",

      "This video is very touching and appreciated.  In 2006, at the age of 19, i travelled from my home in the Appalachian mountains (USA) to Uttarakhand and spent 1 month in the region.  I stayed in a tiny village called Lata that looked very similar to the Harsil valley.  It is somewhat close to Josimath, so a bit farther southeast along the mountain chain and adjacent to Nanda Devi National Park.  It was the first time I had been outside of my own country and I felt so incredibly welcomed and taken care of by the people of this region that it still blows my mind to this day.  Thank you for making and sharing this video with us 🙏🏽",

Also I  remember hearing the song by Led Zepp \" In My Time of Dyin \" during my drug years and made me think about death and Jesus. Then a hippy friend that dug Jesus told me more of Jesus love and forgiveness and how I could also know Jesus love. So in 1981 I cried out to Jesus and wow man He came into my life and I had and have so much joy and peace and now know that through Jesus when I die I will be with Him in Heaven. Hey Jesus loves each of you also and yall can know Him if you are at all open. Just cry out to Him and a good question to ask yourself if you were to die today would you go to heaven ? And if yes why ?  To find out more please read the Gospel of John in the Bible or check out the movie on YouTube. 😀",

If you want to go to a Hike towards the Higher Village towards Old Manali opposite of Club Road. There Buy Hashish or Charas which will be premium it is of a Higher Altitude Village & Manali Hash will be awesome. Kasol is still a more Cosmic but Manali is a Bit More Real you see alot of Police & Roads & Highways & People but Kasol is a small Hamlet in Himalayas with a very pretty river Side earlier it was Heaven till 2017 but now it's very Damaged lost its charm but it is still a good place to go with Family also because Now it's Safe it was Safe Earlier although anything can happen anytime but still Parvati Valley is Cosmic Spiritual Magical Happy but very Mysterious on a whole another like a Cosmic Himalayas Mountains Movie with Aliens Something about Himalayas of India which makes them very Cosmic & Mysterious",

Like once, when I visited Sissu Valley the hotel owner told me they need a few over the counter medication. Stuff that they have to go to Manali or Kullu to get. Sometimes they even ask truck drivers delivering supplies to get it from some distant towns. We had carried quite a few medicines for the village. If you're traveling light, and you can afford a few thousand bucks more in terms of supply, pls carry it. It always helps them out. Those people are super helpful especially when it comes to surviving in the mountains. And just like this, they welcome you in their shops and homes without hesitation.",
