      "Why to waste thousands of Dollars and visit Europe, Switzerland....even the DOLOMITES the mountains are just dry rubbles and not much snow as compared to the olden times. Why to go Bali when literally everything is here in our beautiful country. There are natural springs, pools and fountains with majestic waterfalls in Meghalaya. Lovely snowy peaks from Tawang to Darjeeling to CHOPTA Uttarakhand to Himachal. Deserts and terrains in Rajasthan. Amazing lakes in Himalayas, to Lonavalla to way to Meghalaya, floating island in Manipur, beautiful green valleys like that of DZUKOU in Nagaland. Breath taking views of Tawang and the mighty himalayas to that of Bhutan. The breath taking cinematic night views of AIZAWL city. The river rafting sessions in Arunachal to that in New Zealand. Blue turquoise rivers like that of  Lake Louise and Moraine Lake in Banff National Park lakes in Canada. Scenic tea gardens in Darjeeling and Sikkim to that in Sri Lanka. Frozen lake views in North Sikkim and Ladakh. So much multicultural art and diversity and cultures. Truly unique in it's own way. Just need a cup of tea and a comfy chair to enjoy nature and early morning winter views of Ukhimath Uttarakhand and be thankful to this LIFE and appreciate this moment of how truly blessed we are. Aur kya chahiyeh zindagi koh sukhoon milne keliyeh yeh zindagi mein. 👍Nice channel brow, keep growing like Ankit Bhatia, Ben TK and Sam Kolder.",
