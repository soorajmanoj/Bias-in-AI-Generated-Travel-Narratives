      "I appeal to all foreign people, especially women and girls — please don’t come to India. You are lucky that you escaped rape and that you're still alive. Please, never come to India.\"\n\nI don't want any foreigner to fall into the trap of an Indian. They will behave very friendly with you and do everything to gain your trust, but later they'll start doing everything typical of many Indians—like promoting casteism, making you worship the dead, supporting the dowry system, practicing black magic, lying, and even encouraging sacrifices, including animals, humans, and children. They will teach you to believe in imaginary things that don’t even exist. These things are sadly very common in India, and as foreigners, you could easily get caught in their trap.\"That’s why you should be extra careful, especially if they’re Hindu or Sanatani.\"",

Let form fill with breath essence to the top of the head and there shower as light.\n\nWhen in worldly activities, keep attention between two breaths, and so practicing, in a few days be born anew.\n\nWith intangible breath in center of forehead, as this reaches the heart at the moment of sleep, have direction over dreams and over death itself.\n\nWith utmost devotion,  center on the two junctions of breath and know the knower.\n\nLie down as dead. Enraged in wrath, stay so. Or stare without moving an eyelash. Or suck something and become the sucking.",

      "Please visit Kailasa Temple at Ellora Caves in Maharashtra India. It's considered greatest architecture in history of mankind, because the way it was built seems unbelievable for even today’s time. The temple was built at least 1300 years ago. No stone or nothing was added they carved a mammoth Granite rock/mountain with intricate details. The Kailasa Temple is notable for its vertical excavation-carvers started at the top of the original rock and excavated downward. At least 400000 tonnes of stones have been removed in the process. About 7000 workers and their future generations worked for 135 years. One small mistake and you have to rebuild the whole temple because it's carved into the rock without adding anything, that too up to down. \r\nIt has secret underground tunnels believed to be leading to underground city which is even more mysterious and government have totally locked that down and no researchers are allowed to go inside. \r\nother than Kailasa Temple there are 99 other cave temples there (100 total) of which 34 are open for public viewing. whole temple complex known at Ellora Caves.",

      "WHAT IS SPECIAL ABOUT BEING A HINDU (Sanatana Dharma)?\n\nWritten by Indian Journalist having French roots - François Gautier\n\n1) Believe in God ! - Aastik - Accepted \n2) Don't believe in God ! - You're accepted as Nastik\n3) You want to worship idols - please go ahead. You are a murti pujak.\n4) You dont want to worship idols - no problem. You can focus on Nirguna Brahman-shapeless, formless ,infinite, without beginning or end(nirvikalpa brahama)\n5) You want to criticise something in our religion. Come forward. We are logical. Nyaya, Tarka etc. are core Hindu schools.\n6) You want to accept beliefs as it is. Most welcome. Please go ahead with it.\n7) You want to start your journey by reading Bhagvad Gita - Sure !\n8) You want to start your journey by reading Upanishads - Go ahead.\n9) You want to start your journey by reading Purana - Be my guest.\n10) You just don't like reading Puranas or other books. No problem my dear. Go by Bhakti tradition . ( bhakti- devotion)\n11) You don't like idea of Bhakti ! No problem. Do your Karma. Be a karmayogi.\n12) You want to enjoy life. Very good. No problem at all. This is Charvaka Philosophy.\n13) You want to abstain from all the enjoyment of life & find God - jai ho ! Be a Sadhu, an ascetic !\n14) You don't like the concept of God. You believe in Nature only - Welcome. (Trees are our friends and Prakriti or nature is worthy of worship).\n15) You believe in one God or Supreme Energy. Superb! Follow Advaita philosophy\n16) You want a Guru. Go ahead. Receive gyaan.(gyan yoga)\n17) You don't want a Guru.. Help yourself ! Meditate, Study !(still gyana or raj yoga)\n18) You believe in Female energy ! Shakti is worshipped.\n19) You believe that every human being is equal. Yeah! You're awesome, come on let's celebrate Hinduism! \n \"Vasudhaiva kutumbakam\" (the world is a family)\n20) You don't have time to celebrate the festival.\nDon't worry. One more festival is coming! There are multiple festivals every single day of the year.\n21) You are a working person. Don't have time for religion. Its okay. You will still be a Hindu.\n22) You like to go to temples. Devotion is loved. \n23) You don't like to go to temples - no problem. You are still a Hindu!\n24) You know that Hinduism ☺ is a way of life, with considerable freedom.\n25) You believe that everything has God in it. So you worship your mother, father, guru, tree, River, Prani-matra, Earth, Universe!\n26) And If you don't believe that everything has GOD in it - No problems. Respect your viewpoint.\n27) \"Sarve jana sukhino bhavantu \" (May you all live happily)\n\nYou represent this! You're free to choose, my dear Hindu!\n\nThis is exactly the essence of Hinduism, all inclusive ..  That is why it has withstood the test of time inspite of repeated onslaught both from within and outside,  and assimilated every good aspects from everything . That is why it is eternal !!!\n\nThere is a saying in Rigveda, the first book ever known to mankind which depicts the Hinduism philosophy in a Nutshell - \"Ano Bhadrah Krathavo Yanthu Vishwathah \"- Let the knowledge come to us from every direction\"",

Everyone else are just trend followers and only popular among kids mostly while these guys usually make very different and creative videos which are much better to watch than the usual shit and maybe if these guys had their usual english captions in all vids and a bit of more fame even foreigners would watch them but i dont see that happening for anyone else because all of the others are just living in a small bubble. And also mr beast just really cares about the fame and money which is why he came here for a collab and no other reason because ppl are so close minded and sheeps theyll just hear his name and spend money on his shit. I just hope ppl are gonna be more creative with their content and not just blind trend followers like at this point the tiktok joker is better than these guys for actually setting a trend rather than following like a sheep.",

Why can't people give more love to these guys . They have incredible oneliners and their content is one of the few that is not recycled they keep evolving and to realise that they have only just reached 10M while many others who don't even deserve this achievement have received it way before? I don't know about you guys but I am extremely angry and frustrated on their behalf.\nPls guys continue as you have and I am sure you will receive whatever that you desire soon.\nAnd congratulations on 10M and I am sorry that we as fans weren't able to help you achieve this goal sooner.",
