On YouTube, there’s so much negativity—people often highlight problems in a way that leaves you feeling anxious about our country, life, and struggles in general. But your perspective was so refreshing and uplifting.\n\nWhat really resonated with me was what you said about comfort and empathy. It inspired me to teach my daughter about the challenges others face so she can develop understanding, gratitude, and empathy, and grow up knowing the importance of helping others.\n\nThank you, brother, for such an impactful message!",
