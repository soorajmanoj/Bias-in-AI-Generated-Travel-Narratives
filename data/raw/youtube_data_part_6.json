      "No German Bakery?",
      "Solo travel to India?? After how a Spanish woman was repeatedly raped by 7 men infront of her husband. That same India where a female doctor was gang raped and murdered brutally after 36 hour shift. India gives me chills and u can find thousands of videos of Indian women who say India is so unsafe. But foreign women still travel solo to India for clout due to its massive over population. \n           Some will say “Oh India is not in top 1 country for rape” but do u know more than 85% rape incidents are not reported in India. Only highly disruptive rape cases are highlighted or come in lime light. \n           I really like India and would love to visit in one day. But thousands of videos of Indian women crying for women safety still remains in my memories. \n              Maybe South India is different. Cuz traumatizing rape cases that I heard of like Nirvaya,Ankita Bhandari,Manipur naked incident and Dr Moumita are all from North parts of India. Maybe South India is safe and would love to visit it one day.",

That is why it is eternal !!!\n\nThere is a saying in Rigveda, the first book ever known to mankind which depicts the Hinduism philosophy in a Nutshell - \"Ano Bhadrah Krathavo Yanthu Vishwathah \"- Let the knowledge come to us from every direction\"",

      "Tahukah Anda bahwa India telah berjuang mati matian dalam berbagai level..baik dari Sosial..Budaya..politik..Ekonomi bahkan Diplomasi Tingkat Dunia \nUntuk meminta kembali benda benda pusaka..manuskrip manuskrip..catatan catatan kuno dari peninggalan Leluhur Bangsa India untuk dikembalikan dari Inggris..\n  Inggris yang menjajah india Ratusan tahun juga telah menjarah benda benda bersejarah milik bangsa bangsa jajahan nya..termasuk Mesir,Dan sebagian besar Afrika\n Negara negara bekas jajahan Inggris itu semua berjuang untuk mendapatkan kembali Harta pusaka peninggalan nenek moyang Bangsa mereka..\nTenaga..biaya..waktu dan segala kemampuan mereka kerahkan..demi kembalinya harta pusaka mereka\n  Dan dengan perjuangan keras dan lama..akhirnya mereka berhasil mendapatkan kembali harta tak termilai besarnya itu ke pangkuan bangsa mereka kembali..\n\nDan Tahukah Anda\n Bahwa puluhan Ribu manuskrip dan benda  bersejarah asal Nusantara diangkut Ke Belanda dan memenuhi museum museum mereka untuk di pamerkan..\n  \nSebuah kecelakaan kita Alami..kebodohan hakiki yang menjangkiti otak bangsa ini...\n       Tanpa Diminta\n  Pada tahun 1997 ada wacana pengembalian secara bertahap dari Belanda kepada Indonesia..walaupun sedikit demi sedikit..blm ada tanggapan terhadap tawaran Belanda saat itu karena situasi politik dan keamanan negara kita waktu itu..\n   Lalu pada tahun 2004 saat situasi politik dan keamanan telah stabil..kembali pemerinta Belanda menawarkan pada pemerintah RI untuk mengembalikan benda benda sejarah itu secara bertahap..\n Tidak ada tanggapan positif dari pemerintahan SBY waktu itu..dengan alasan tak memiliki tempat penyimpanan serta teknologi dan sumber daya untuk merawat benda benda itu..😡😡😡😡😡\n  Baru pada beberapa hari lalu..atas kesadaran dari pemerintah belanda..467 benda sejarah dan manuskrip itu kembali diserahkan ke Indonesia\n    467 dari sekitar 40.000 ..bisa anda bayangkan betapa sedikit dan kecilnya yg kembali ke kita..\n\nBangsa Durhaka\n  Diawal saya tulis beratnya bangsa India dan Mesir untuk mengambil kembali benda sejarah mereka dari tangan Asing..\n  Tapi betapa Enaknya pemerintah kita..ketika tanpa perjuangan dan pengorbanan..pemerintah Belanda malah menawarkan untuk mengembalikan dan justru kita yang Ogah Ogahan..\nBangsa macam apa ini..\n  Bangsa durhaka yg menolak tinggalan leluhurnya sendiri..bangsa bodoh yang tanpa berjuang mendapatkan harta pusaka super mahal tapi enggan menerima..\n\nJika bukan bangsa Durhaka..\n  Tentu sejak 2004 jika memang ada keinginan..pastilah segera mempersiapkan segala sesuatunya..tentu hanya butuh beberapa tahun saja untuk mempersiapkan..tidak harus menunggu 2023 untuk mendapatkan nya kembali..\n  Ayo bantahen jika kita bukan bangsa durhaka..\n\nTapi ingat..467 yg dikembalikan kemarin hanya 1 % dari jumlah total harta bersejarah kita yang diangkut ke Belanda..dan Tugas pemerintah RI untuk merebut yg 99%..\n  Seperti yang dilakukan oleh pemerintah India Dan Mesir..kita harus mengerahkan daya dan upaya serta segala kemampuan untuk mengembalikan Harta Leluhur kita kembali.\n\nPemerintah yang didominasi manusia manusia berotak Kadrun yang lupa dan abai pada leluhur Sendiri..terlihat malas dan Enggan untuk merawat dan merebut kembali harta leluhur nya sendiri\n   Mereka lebih suka menghamburkan uang untuk Subsidi piknik Ke Arab Saudi puluhan Triliun tiap tahun..uang dihamburkan tanpa guna..mensubsidi kerjaan Unfaedah dan memperkaya Negara lain..pola fikir Agama Gurun telah membuat kita tak bisa berfikir Sehat\n  Daripada membangun Museum dan pusat penelitian terhadap ilmu dan teknologi Nusantara sendiri\n\nKita Hidup di Negeri Durhaka...ingatlah..kita akan tetap sengsara dan Primitif..jika tak berubah dan merevolusi diri.",
