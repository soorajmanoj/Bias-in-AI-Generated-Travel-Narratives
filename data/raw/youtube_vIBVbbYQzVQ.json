        "Life is like a war easy to starts but difficult to finish or accept. \n\nDuring my life I  learned that life, helping people and be honest / grateful are most important things that we can have and support others with. \n \nEvery moment the world is constantly to show it to us but we don’t care about it. For few people yes 🙌 - we care. \n\nI never stopped one day to think on having a brilliant fenominal crazy adventure with foreign people that I don’t know like I did . My dream never allowed this kind of thinking And now I can’t consider you like a foreign anymore, we share and we painted one of the most beautiful stories in my country, in our soul and heart.  \n\nIt was a pleasure to meet all of you in this peaceful and lovely country “São Tomé 🇸🇹”   Now I can say that the world know us a little more 🌎\n\nI know that time is not forever ♾️ and also I know that at least we are together. \n\nValbon President.😹",

        "1. Cosmic Purpose and Synchronicity:\n\n•\tInterconnectedness: From a perspective of \"cosmic purpose,\" one might view the chance meeting between influential YouTubers and Valbone as a manifestation of a larger, interconnected web of events. The travelers' decision to embrace \"Lev Lev\" (living step by step) led them to São Tomé, and within that flow, they encountered Valbone. This could be interpreted as a form of synchronicity, a concept introduced by Carl Jung, where seemingly unrelated events occur together in a meaningful way, without a causal link.\n•\tDestiny or Alignment: If one believes in a \"cosmic purpose,\" this encounter could be seen as an alignment of individual paths. Perhaps Valbone's ambition to lead his country, combined with the YouTubers' global reach, created a specific energetic or intentional resonance that drew them together. The encounter, then, serves a larger, unfolding narrative that extends beyond the individuals involved, potentially influencing the future of São Tomé and Príncipe or even inspiring global audiences.\n•\tThe Unfolding Narrative: The \"cosmic purpose\" might suggest that this specific interaction was \"meant to be,\" contributing to a grander narrative or evolution. It highlights how seemingly small, chance encounters can have ripple effects, potentially influencing the trajectory of individuals and communities in ways that are not immediately apparent.",

To Valbon, the one destined to lead with a heart full of kindness,\n\nIn this vast world, there are few who carry within them the power to change lives—not through words alone, but through the simple, quiet force of kindness. You, Valbon, have been touched by this rare gift. It is a gift that transcends borders, a light that shines brighter than all the material riches this world can offer. Your heart beats for something far greater than yourself. In your hands, we see the possibility of a new dawn for São Tomé, a future built not upon power, but upon love, compassion, and the deep belief that each person can make a difference.\n\nThe true essence of leadership is not in the title one holds, but in the ability to listen, to understand, and to uplift those who need it most. In your journey, Valbon, you have shown us that greatness does not arise from selfish ambition, but from the desire to serve, to heal, and to guide others toward their own light. The power you seek is not of dominance, but of unity, the power to bring people together with kindness and wisdom.\n\nI believe in your vision, Valbon. I believe that with your guidance, the souls of São Tomé will be awakened, their potential realized, and their spirits freed from the chains of fear and poverty. You have the gift of seeing the world not just as it is, but as it could be—and in that vision lies the future of not only your country but of us all. You will remind us all that leadership is not the art of commanding, but the art of loving.\n\nValbon, you were born not to follow the path, but to create one. A path where people are not measured by what they own, but by the kindness they give. A path where the only currency is the goodwill of a community bound together by trust and respect.\n\nIn your hands, the power to change the world is not a dream, it is a living, breathing possibility. So let your heart lead you, Valbon. The time is now. The world is waiting for you to show them that kindness, when wielded with wisdom, can change everything.This should give Valbon the message of inspiration and faith in his ability to lead with kindness and vision.",

Since then, people have been protesting for accountability and change. For over a year these protests were peaceful, but recently they’ve escalated as police and  military began using force against peaceful demonstrators.\n\nMany Serbians feel their voices aren’t being heard, and your platform could help share this struggle with the world.

We heard about a book called Manifest the Unseen by Luna Rivers on a podcast, and I was hesitant at first. But after reading just a few chapters, I realized how much I was missing. Luna's approach is so different from anything I’ve ever tried. It’s not just about thinking positive, it’s about aligning with real-world actions that bring your desires into reality. Now, I’ve manifested opportunities I never imagined possible, and my mindset has shifted completely. If you’re frustrated like I was, don’t hesitate. Read this book. It will change everything ❤",

I'm a U.S Army veteran and when I went through basic training for almost 4 months we had no cell phones and we had nothing to connect with the outside world besides letters. It gives you a new appreciation for everything that you have every single day. Not only did you guys remind to put my phone down a little bit more but you made me remember that amazing feeling of showing kindness to anyone even if you don't know them. I don't know if anybody will ever see this but after watching this video I am now looking into going to somewhere in Africa to help out with humanitarian aid and just help the people less fortunate than us. It was so amazing seeing the generosity/compassion and the love from these people that it sparked something in me again to just want to go help everyone as much as I can. these people deserve the world with the love and kindness they show to everyone no matter who they are. I envy this kind of community and care about one another beyond belief. Thank you so much and god bless all of you guys for what you do. Also if anybody knows anywhere I can get in contact with some people for some mission trips or humanitarian aide missions please reach out to me!!!\n\nVALBON FOR PRESIDENT!!!!",

        "Boys, instead of a gift maybe you could convince him to take the money as an investment in starting a business. I could see an e-bike sales or rentals plus some solar panels being a good start in that country. This bright young man would be able to see the potential of that for his small country, even being a model for other African cities or towns. Speak to the good people at Waka Waka I believe based in the Netherlands who have invested in solar powered lights and power banks across Africa and other areas. I’m sure they would be able to give you some pointers to pass on. They even started a virtual grid in Rwanda and when people paid to rent their solar power bank when they had paid enough they owned it. Lots of interesting  ideas, for you to invest in people and who knows you could be on the ground floor of exciting new country and know the president. All the best and greetings from me here in Australia. 😊",

        "I’ve enjoyed this video, along with others… but the message? Ummm… it’s delivered on YouTube, and you’ve all built a 10-year career on it. How many hours is that? And it wouldn’t be as ironic, except you did an in-video ad @ around 5:00, and promoted merch at the end. Capitalism through and through. Yet, you still did a sort of homily at the end clearly against social media. So, it moved beyond just ironic to outright hypocrisy…especially since nothing about this was to “disconnect” from internet/social media. \n\nNot only was it a curated video made for YouTube, but it was funded by both YouTube and capitalism. I don’t usually comment on your videos, which I’ve been watching for years, but virtue signaling is a bit much. I don’t like it on any channel (yours isn’t the first) but this one is especially hypocritical. Happy 10-year anniversary of doing exactly what you’ve criticized at the end (but still posted the video). \n\nNearly 10 years of watching your videos without commenting—even after the dramatic “change” in tone and moving back to France—I’ve never commented a criticism. So, I’m not a troll. I’m someone who thinks the “moral” of this video was ridiculously hypocritical and felt compelled to comment, which I’d hope doesn’t make it easy or quick to dismiss. \n\nThe message wasn’t just about doing this with no phone or Internet. It was about the insidious and dehumanizing nature of phones/internet, all while delivering it on that medium, building a career on it, and likely continuing to. That’s not even mentioning the in-video ad or the merch, accessed via internet/phones.\n\nI’d suggest not virtue signaling on things you all really know nothing about. Just my humble opinion as a watcher for many years.",

        "A little history about São Tomé e Príncipe 🇸🇹 and also about Cabo Verde 🇨🇻 \nThey were not Portuguese colonies. They were deserted islands prior to Portuguese colonization. They used them to “store” slaves and to trade slaves. \nWhile other islands like Madeira and Açores were colonized by white Portuguese and so, they still are today part of Portugal. \n\nSome of us (Portuguese), and some of CV and STP do believe that maybe our countries would be in a better position if we stayed with Portugal.\n(I say this, this way, but my mother is from Angola, 🇦🇴 and my father despite being Portuguese was born and raised in France 🇫🇷)",

        "Man, this reminds me of my trip around the world (2009-2010). I had a brand new iPhone 3G (i chose that instead of a laptop for convenience). Back then i did not exploit the whole potential of it (at least at start), so i had to print maps, get phrase books, book most hotels and stays in advance... and go with the flow. It was a wonderful experience! I have to say that i was more prepared than them, basically back then it was common to prepare trips properly and have maps and a set plan and have routes and addresses printed. Thanks!",

        "And as far as the guy on the boat ahowing up, you are three white people with two locals , everyone on the entire island knows about you within 1 week of being on an island that size😂  in India, you can leave your socks in the mountains travel 10 days to a hotel and go down for tea to the beach to watch the siubrise and someone will run up to with the socks you left on  the mountain 10 days earlier .  The thing is the powers that created the matrix have conditioned people to believe that we can not exist outside of it.  That is not true. Things still get done and people keep living without cell phone and without rigid schedules",

        "It’s strange to me that people are so attached to their cell phones that they think it’s an epic crate to do things without it. You do know people travelled all over the world for centuries without cell phones. We have only had cell phone for a few years. I didn’t get one u tol I was in my mid 30s and travelled for 15 years without one. It’s a small island you are on. Regardless, it’s exciting to do anything for the first time. Hopefully this experience will allow you to plan your content less and therefore ha e more time to truly experience each country without already knowing where you will end up.",
