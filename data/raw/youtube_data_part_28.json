      "Perfect video! Thanks to the author of the channel for this fascinating video! It is interesting to see how people live in other countries! It is very important to know foreign languages on such trips. I would like to recommend to all travelers a practical guide to learning foreign languages by Yuriy Ivantsiv \"Polyglot Notes. Practical tips for learning foreign languages\". This book contains a lot of useful tips on how to learn a foreign language for tourists, students, entrepreneurs and anyone who needs a foreign language in life. There are a lot of good tips on how to solve problems with the language from beginner to advanced level of language learning. It turns out that the traveler only needs to know a few dialogues and you can easily travel around the world! You don't have to spend a lot of time to fully learn a foreign language, you just need to learn what you can use when you travel. I wish everyone exciting travel",
