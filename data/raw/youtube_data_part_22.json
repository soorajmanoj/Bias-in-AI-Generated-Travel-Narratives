      "Diwali marks the return of Bhagwan Ram from exile after killing Ravan for his unrighteousness way of life involving touching(grabbing onto the hand) of a married woman therefore symbolizing victory of truth and righteousness over lies and unrighteousness way of life concomitantly it marks several other tales such as Mata Kaali's pooja and and Bhagwan Krishna defeating a rakchas named Narkasura; my point is it is more important for the people who celebrate especially the youth to take learnings from these festivals first then the sweets and bursting crackers because they light the way a good human being should walk on.\nI hope you truly enjoyed the festival, certainly it can be rather heavy if its your first time especially when you're not used to the noise, but the moment with your loved ones engulfed in joy and happiness envelopes the noise and makes the moment remarkable, personally the pooja and rangolis and decorating the house are my favorite part as they help people bond not just families but everyone, would love to know how you felt about your experience.\n\nPS; the poojas can get boring given the mantras are in Sanskrit a way around is understanding its meaning which in itself is a story and makes every pooja more interesting and easier to dedicate oneself to it that is if you wish. \n\nstay blessed, happy and may you all have a happy and prosperous life",

Being a dietitian who works specifically with pregnant and postpartum mothers, I wanted to share a few gentle suggestions that may help:\n\n• You can add curry-leaf water along with your soaked nuts in the morning.\n• Try to have short, frequent meals.\n• Include protein and fibre in every meal — paneer, sprouts, dal, rajma, chole, lobia, kadhi, and soya (if your thyroid levels are stable), etc.\n• Add 1 tsp of roasted flax seeds to your diet.\n• A small serving of roasted chana before bed may help with fasting sugar levels.\n• Try to walk for at least 15 minutes after meals.\n• Prenatal yoga can also help — practice according to your placenta position and medical advice.\n• Prioritise good sleep, as pregnancy hormones, stress, and sleep quality are closely connected.\n\nP.S. If anyone from her team sees this, please pass it along.\nLots of love to Golla ❤️\nMany blessings to you and Harsh bhaiya.",

Din bhar mein thoda-thoda karke 5–6 baar khana khaayein aur meethi cheezein jaise chini, mithai, cold drink, cake, biscuit wagaira ko avoid karein. Chawal aur safed roti kam lein, aur fiber wale foods jaise daliya, brown rice, multigrain roti, salad aur hari sabziyon ko diet ka hissa banaayein. Phal theek hote hain, lekin aam, angoor, banana jaise zyada meethay phal kam khaayein. Protein ke liye daal, anda, doodh, chana, rajma jaise foods bahut faydemand hote hain. Roz 8–10 glass paani piyein aur meetha juice bilkul na lein.

Mere wife oh v amritsar sahib toh ne. Ohna di v Early morning fasting wali sugar high aa rahi c (5.6 to 6.2) . To lower the sugar levels, our specialist in Canada and all doctors in Canada recommended these steps - no gap or fasting more than 4-5.5 hours in between meals ( have some small snacks in between), walk 15-20 mins minimum after meals, after dinner have some milk (3 hour gap after dinner) or something lighter with protein source before going to bed and between last food at night (eg. milk around 9 pm) and eat something in morning around 6.30 -7 am or so. It should be fine. Bs walk karo after every meal, avoid all kind of sugar except fruits, dont take any stress, as per your sugar levels baby n you are fine from gestational diabetes . Assi v golle nu dekh ke apne baby nu imagine krde aa. Baba deep singh g vdia hi krn ge. N i guess tohada 1-2 months hi hona mai apne wife nu keh ditta c tusi pregnant ho and baby girl hi honi aa.

      "Hi Bharti. I am from US. When i got gestational diabetes during pregnancy I was sent to registered dietitian who educated me how many carbs is in 1 roti, 1 cup of dal, or any subzi. They basically gave me food chart that said 2 dhokla is 30 gms of carbs as an example. Also during pregnancy you should not skip carbs. I was told to eat 160 gms of carbs a day for proper brain development of the baby. I was eating breakfast, snack, lunch, snack, dinner, bedtime snack. My post meal sugar was controlled with exercise. So after every meal i walked for 30 mins. When it rained, i had stationary bike so\nI used to bike. Fasting was still something i couldnt control so i was put on metformin small dose at bedtime. If sugar is high the baby is going to be huge. So you will also have frequent ultrasounds.\nI am wondering why your doctor is not educating you and just saying eat healthy. Even if you eat millets, 3 roti is lot of carbs. Your blood sugar will spike. Add atleast 30 grams of protein per meal. Add healthy fats and fiber. I used to eat 1 roti because i had dal, subzi, yogurt and all has carbs. Hope this helps.",

      "Hey Bharti ❤️& Harsh please explain to her ⬇️\nHi, I’m a nutritionist Suprina, let me explain something important.\n\nYour blood sugar can still go high during pregnancy even if you don’t eat sweets or feel stressed. It happens because the placenta releases hormones that make your body insulin-resistant. So your body doesn’t use glucose properly and sugar levels rise.\n\nAlso remember — it’s not just sugar. Foods like rice, roti, potatoes, milk, bread and fruits also convert into glucose. This is common in pregnancy and is called gestational diabetes.\n\nNow how to control it:\n\n✅ Eat small frequent meals (3 meals + 2–3 healthy snacks)\n✅ Choose better carbs like oats, dal, brown rice, whole wheat roti, veggies\n❌ Limit white rice, potatoes, bread, pasta, sweets and juices\n✅ Add protein every time you eat — eggs, dal, paneer, chicken, curd, nuts\n🚶‍♀️ Walk 10–20 mins after meals\n\n💊 And if diet & walking aren’t enough, medicine or insulin may be needed — and it’s safe for the baby.\n\nManaging your sugar will help prevent complications and keep both you and your baby healthy. 💛\n\n 😊",

      "Hi Bharti, \n\nIt's lovely watching your vlogs everyday. My 20 month old daughter loves watching Golla. She dances on the title song. \n\nRegarding your gastational diabetes, I think it is very important for you to control your diet. I know you're food lover. It's just a matter of couple of more months. Mishri, ghur, or chakar... nothing is good. If you think these are alternatives to sugar. That's not right. You have to give up on this. I did the same. \n\nYour doctor can recommend insulin if it going beyond your control. But if can control with brtter diet, that's the best...\n\nYou will be fine... just follow your doctor's recommendations. My best wishes",

Okay, so Pregnancy me agar Sugar high aa raha hai toh pehle toh thoda risk rehta hai mummy ko but manageable..  main problem is ke if control nahi karte toh Baby jab born hota hai toh aapka glucose zyada ho toh baby me insulin badh jaata hai jiske wajah se baby ko respiratory distress ho sakta hai... But that is also manageable don't worry.... Now is the best time jab apko pata chala hai toh thode lifestyle changes and management karne se bohottt farak pad jaata hai...\n\nIsiliye, no stress, very common to have high sugar... Just follow a few steps as suggested by your doctor depending on your sugar levels and sab thik hoga... Love you Bharti Ma'am",
