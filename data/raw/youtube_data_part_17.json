      "Thanks for watching my dudes! Are YOU looking to travel India efficiently, effectively and not break the bank? Check out my in-depth Travel Guide where I delve into all aspects of traveling India and how to do it affordably! https://www.noahvde.com/store/indiaguide",
      "Hello. Where to get that first aid kit bag. TIA",
      "You forgot to add Divestive Advantage. You need that in order to travel India. If not, you will get sick. Digestive Advantage is so good, you can eat pretty much Indian street food all day and not get sick. Obviously, make sure the street food is hot and cooked fresh. (avoid meat, raw vegetables, and sea food)\n\nAlso, choose franchise hostels like Zostel and Mustache. They have shared rooms and single rooms as well. Super affordable and clean. Plus, found in every major city and town with attractions throughout India.",
