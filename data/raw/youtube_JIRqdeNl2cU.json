        "Gutted for Norris. Deserves the chip, but just not his year",
        "An crazy restart after the summerbreak, Max best save of the year overtake for sure, heartbreaking moment for Lando, and as I predicted Russell & Charles presents a show, but Antonelli risky dive bomb on Charles never ends well in that banking corner, Hamilton very unlikely driving error, no one expected that Hadjar finish on the podium, haas & Williams to score double points and Yuki finally back in top 10, Lawson defends too risky, Piastri perfection from lights to flag to secure his first grand slam and being the 3rd different driver since the comeback to win at Zandvoort eventually taken his 9th win to equalise his manager and forever \"Not bad for a number 2 driver\" mark Webber winning record, crazy that even stroll & Alonso take the points, Ferrari nightmare, Max tries at the last restart but Piastri was in control of an title contending drive, 2023 it was Alonso who took the spotlight but no one expected that Isack got that handful luck and 1 in a million opportunity to take the podium in his rookie season just phenomenal he even outbeat Seb from 2007, what a way to start the 2nd half of the season and the road to Abu Dhabi mission🔥🍾😎🏁😭❤️🤩🏆⚡👏👏🥳🎉🏎️",

        "Show Alex overtaking 5 cars in 30 seconds on lap 1! The media keep sleeping on Albon! I’ve heard multiple podcasts with engineers and even team principals that rate Alex highly, particularly as the closest match to Max at Red Bull. I literally want to start a campaign for him to get more coverage and respect lol",

        "He is flying..",
        "i want to get into F1, can anyone help?",

        "9gag says Leclerc sitting on the hill is \"casually aura-farming\" is absolutly ridiculous",
        "I told you. I'm not a conspirator. McLaren is sabotaging Norris to ensure a championship for Piastri (themselves). What is it this week? Shrapnel in the oil tank?? You can't have McLaren 1 & 2 in Abu Dhabi because they are going to crash into each other. McLaren knows that. Ironically that rivalry was created by McLaren forcing Norris to move aside last season for exactly the same selfish reasons (Max won anyways). This is not sportsmanship, it's politics.",
        "So let's get this clear, Hamilton at a lower speed, reducing application of the throttle, braking, braking earlier. All of this but in the document, they're saying Hamilton failed to slow. In my view your document is ridiculous, you at the FIA are silly and operate on the level of WWF.",

        "Hadjar!!!!! 🎉🎉",
        "So few comments addressing the fact that Norris probably just lost his championship run in this race!  Unless Piastri suffers the same fate it's highly unlikely he'll make up the points.  IT'S OVER!",
        "Is it a bird? Is it a plane? No, its Lando's championship flying away!",

        "Leclerc absolutely mugged Russell in this race. They haven't even shown the 1st overtake Leclerc did on Russell, which just looked so effortles.",
        "Carlos Sainz is the overtaking car and never gets more than the engine cover alongside Lawson and expects to be let through? He also gets loose on the sandy wide line he takes which slows his exit. the corner was Lawsons who got a faster exit: Sainz caused the avoidable collision. That is why Sainz front wheel and Lawsons rear wheel connected. Sainz being blown away by ALBON, haha yet I am sure he has many excuses to mansplain.",

Alpine should put Doohan back in for the rest of the season, they did him so wrong. His last performance on the track was better than anything colapinto has done so far.",

        "When Red Bull and Racing Bull having issue on Lawson and Tsunoda, Hadjar is just stay low profile all the time. He is second driver after Tsunoda in Racing Bull. But look at the situation now Hadjar is just behind of Verstappen. His performance improve from race to race and so much better than Tsunoda. Tsunoda desperately wanted to promote to first team and he is now extremely embarrassing among all F1 driver. More humiliating is his former teammate Hadjar is even better than him.",
        "Oof, wouldn't wanna be Norris right now. Anti-climatic and disappointing all in one go. C'mon Lando, it's not over yet!",

        "how dumb is antonelli \nlets just drive straight into leclerc \nsainz was in control he should have gave lawson space\nthen hes surpised he gets a penalty. when kids go racing \nloved seeing hadjar on the podium",

        "Sainz was right. That has to rank amongst one of the worst decisions I've ever seen. He was alongside, Lawson opened up the throttle too early and ran wide on exit and into Sainz. So, where was he supposed to go? It's no different to a driver turning in on another as if he wasn't there. Sainz was holding his line, Lawson was not.",
