During the Muslim conquests of India (during the rule of the Mughal dynasty which originally hailed from Uzbekistan), one of the Muslim Emperor grabbed the Taj forcefully from the then Hindu King.\n\nThus please remember that, the Taj Mahal is a Hindu Palace Temple complex built by the Hindus and usurped by the then oppressive Muslim rulers of Central India.\n\nDuring the British colonization of India the Taj Mahal was further stripped off (or in other words looted) it's glory, and what remains now is just the skeleton of the originally marvelous piece of art.",

      "The minarets (towers) are built 2 degrees out not so they can fall outwards during an earthquake... (I apologize on behalf of whoever gave you that wrong and silly idea!) it's actually designed like that to counter an optical effect, I forget what the effect is called but its basically the fact that tall objects look narrower at the top as they recede away from you.. by building them further away at the top, they end up lining up straight (and perfectly horizontal, rather than looking like its tipping inwards) when you look at the monument from the front, as you enter through that doorway, and even before when you picture it in the doorway when you first get to see it. The same technique is used in the Arabic calligraphy on the gateways and on the taj itself, it gets bigger at the top so that it looks straight and symmetrical to anyone who's looking at it from below.",

      "The four towers of the Taj are slanted outwards because thats how you get the illusion of them standing straight from afar. When you look at Taj Mahal, the towers look symmetrical and standing parallel to the central dome. However if they were actually straight, from afar it would have looked like they are pointed inwards, towards the dome. The Minars are hence slanted outwards. \n\nThe earthquake thingy is actually one small aspect of it. The real reason is the visual masterpiece.",

      "You look beutifull in saree😍😍",
      "Nice Video, you can also see 2nd Taj Mahal of Agra link is below https://youtu.be/iV9Q1RLM4a8",
      "The rumor is that the person who commissioned to make this Taj Mahal, Shah Jahan had killed the architect and all those who worked on this 7 wonders of the world project had their hand cut so that there will be one and only Taj Mahal, but the irony is that today the Mughal empires’s descendants are living on meagre pension from Indian government ( US 100$ a month ) and some descendants are doing odd jobs to survive. So tell me did the cries and sadness caused by these kings had gone unheard by God or is it karma that caught up with their descendants, you be the judge. By the way excellent video.",

      "How come your videos are good all the time? I believe I know the answer. I see that your suitcase handle is broken. I can imagine the difficulty in handling luggage especially when you're a frequent traveller. If I may, I would like to suggest you purchase suitcase from brands like Victorinox because of product quality and extensive international warranty . I'm also aware this getting a premium suitcase would be slightly difficult because of traveling expenses but I guess it is better than purchasing suitcase multiple times because of wear and tear. Alternatively,  you may also distribute your luggage in Rucksack or duffle bag or so to prevent damage to your suitcase. I just wanted to help therefore I thought to share it with you. I guess you would have got exhausted by reading such a long comment. Sorry for that. Anyways, thanks for sharing your experience and hope to see you soon guys.",

You would be overwhelmed by the number of people coming in and I hope you would have a wonderful experience which you won't forget.!",

I cried the first time I saw it and it was spontaneous, I was in college and with friends nothing romantic but shear size and beauty made tears come out.

      "Fun fact: There was going to be made a similar black Taj Mahal opposite the White one on the other side of the Yamuna River. The black one  would symbolise Shah Jahan and the White one would symbolise his wife Mumtaz Mahal.

      "छत्तीसगढ़ जंगलों, मंदिरों और वाटरफाल्स के लिए जाना जाता है। इस राज्य की सुदंरता कुछ अलग ही है। आज आप यहां के ऐसे स्पॉट्स के बारे में जानेंगे, जहां लोगों रहस्यमय शक्तियों को महसूस किया है। इनमें से एक है यहां पर जगलपुर का ये हॉन्टेड हाउस। कहते हैं कि इस घर में एक शैतानी आत्मा रहती है और इस घर में जो भी जाता है, वह वापस नहीं लौटता है। लोग बताते हैं कि एक आदमी हिम्मत करके अंदर गया और फिर कभी बाहर नहीं आ पााया। ये घर बस्तर के बाजवंत के पास है। लोगों का मानना है कि इस घर के अंदर एक आदमी का भूत है, जो ये नहीं चाहता कि कोई घर के अंदर रहे। दूसरी हाॅन्टेड जगह है तारबहार रेलवे क्रॉसिंग। बिलासपुर की ये जगह बहुत ही खतरनाक है। ये जगह तब भुतहा हो गई, ट्रेन ने 18 लोगों को कुचल दिया। लोग बताते हैं कि वो आत्माएं लोगों को परेशान करती हैं, जब वे रात में क्रॉसिंग पार कर रहे होते हैं। लोग बताते हैं कि यहां दिखता है कि कई लोग क्रॉसिंग पार कर है और इसी दौरान ट्रेन भी यहां से गुजरती है, लेकिन उन्हें कुछ नहीं होता है। ये आत्माओं का मायााजाल है। ये जगह बहुत ही खतरनाक जगहों में से एक है, जहां लोग रात के वक्त गुजरना पसंद नहीं करते हैं। अगली भुतही जगह गैरेज रोड। ये रोड दो- तीन किलोमीटर लंबा है। इस रोड में सिर्फ अंधेरा भरा रहता है और यहां पर रोशनी की कोई गुंजाइश नहीं है। लोग बताते हैं कि जब वे इस रास्ते से गुजर रहे होते हैं, तो एक औरत लिफ्ट मांगती हैं। जब वे लिफ्ट दे देते हैं तो महिला कार में बैठने के कुछ देर बाद गायब हो जाती है। यहां कुछ ऐसी और भी छत्तीसगढ़ की हॉन्टेड स्टोरीज हैं। bhai is chij ko explore kariye",
