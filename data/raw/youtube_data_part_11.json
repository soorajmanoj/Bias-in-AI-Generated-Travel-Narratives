      "Very negative video with a misleading title. It should be only cons. Some of it is helpful but overall it's negative. India is a great place to travel.",
      "It's so refreshing to see someone with a genuine reflection. No negativity or racism for views.",
      "youre pretty spot on. i love india. heading back in may.",
      "Dude, are you okay in your head? Yeah, yeah, keep loving India...",
      "I agree with you a hundred percent on the cheating thing. Great job for helping to status standard.",
      "感谢您的分享！ 只是我有一个简单的题外话问题： 我的OKX钱包里有USDT，并且我有恢复短语. 「pride」-「pole」-「obtain」-「together」-「second」-「when」-「future」-「mask」-「review」-「nature」-「potato」-「bulb」. 将它们转移到Binance的最佳方法是什么？",
      "Best thing to do is make a friend with a local to explore & not get cheated & use all the hacks & shortcuts & expenses etc..",
      "Thank you! I am getting ready to backpack through India, and this is exactly the type of information I was looking for. To me, not being from a traditional WASP american background, a lot of these cons are exactly the kind of culture im looking for",
      "Loved your honest take on the pros and cons of travelling in India, Brock! It's refreshing to hear both sides of the experience. Has any particular city or village in the north stood out to you the most?",
      "After digitalisation in India..a lot changed in 5 yr…lot of things you can do online now mention in video",
      "Uber and Ola are easily available,  lots of star hotels are there for foreign  tourist...going to cheaper place ,  want to experience   to co exist among  poor people  n then blaming  about  ppl staring  at you is not right\n\nVisit goa,kerala for beaches...himalaya  for snow,  hillstation in north east are beautiful,  falls n historical  places in karnataka n Maharashtra  are awesome...\n\nLooking  for pubs n party ing visit goa n blore..\n\nStart hotels are built at every corner for u ppl...\n\nRich and poor co exist here...u need luxury u get it here, do u need cheaper life style u will ger it hear...expecting luxury from poor ppl is not right",
      "India is a Unique Country it is very different from Europe or America or non Asian or African Countries. U can also visit nearby Countries like Afghanistan, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Tibbet, Bangladesh to get a idea of India. India has Himalayas which provides Fresh & Purest Air to India & are very Dangerous but also Beautiful U can see Garbage but still they are really Worth to Check. If U need a Balanced Exposure of Indian Himalayas go to Manali & nearby Areas. Manali in Himachal Pradesh is one of the most visited Hill Stations on Earth. It's Like a City but great Views. Old Manali is surely a Area to check out. U fill face no problem of Transport or Hotels or other stuff as Everything is available there according to Money U spend from 1 Rs Matchbox to Expensive Food & Stays. U have to come to New Delhi to go Himalayas. If U want less people & less crowded Areas go beyond Manali like Spiti Valley, Kinnaur Valley & other Areas. Laddakh is also a very Popular Tourist Destination",
      "Hi \nGreat overview. \nPlaning to go to India (God willing) over the summer. Have done a ton of research. \n\nI’ve been to Kathmandu and many other remote places such as a village far off in China. Used to such adventures.\n\nI find India to be that one country that I have to visit before I get any older (38 now). \nI was about 5-6 years old when my parents and I with siblings traveled to India and I still remember it like it was yesterday. Back then it was called Bombay and we did come across plenty of hardship. But a memorable trip nonetheless. \n\nTimes have changed and I’m sure it’s easier now to do this as a solo traveler vs with small kids and family 28-29 years ago. \n\nBackpacking my way (God willing) for 3 weeks.",
      "I am and have been interested in visiting India. Your pros and cons are very helpful for me to get myself ready for the great adventure. Thank you for sharing.",
      "In fact India is probably a number of the countries on my list that I will not travel to. Aside from the fact that it's not clean, they don't treat women fairly, just a couple of months ago, a Brazilian-Spanish white woman was gang-raped by 7 Indian men in front of her husband in Dumka. And the Indian authority just paid her 10,000 rupees to shut her up as if nothing has happened.",
      "They'll never get there",
      "Repulsive is really a strong word to use, based on you lack of understanding. If you, a foreign, do not come to their country, stay in yours.",
      "They ask you your name and parents information because in india, everything is based on family (class system) although  it said that no longer exist, but it does. They are not being rude. In india, everything is based on family respect and community. Those are not weird questions, YOUR IN INDIA, NOT HOME.",
      "thanks for this video, very helpful! i was wondering about transport if you buy tickets online by example redbus or rome2rio, do you recommend this or does this create even more chaos?",
      "India is absolutely disgusting.  How can humans treat their own land the way they do?",
      "Good",
      "Good journey bro 😊",
      "Will be visiting Monday Im open to all ..",
      "There is no need for sim cards if your phone is e-sim equipped.  I used Airalo.... but other options are available.    Have your phone ready to go as soon as your plane 😅lands.",
      "I've been there and for me the cons far outweigh the benefits.",
      "Your vision is wrong bro",
      "Your thinking is perfectly wrong",
      "“Animal at zoo” 💀",
      "Unpopular opinion: If people want to cheat you for a few cents, let them. It's a lot more money to them than it is to you. 100 Rupees is like $1. If they're nice and helpful to you, call it a tip and move on. It's not worth making a fuss over. If you can afford the $1,000 or whatever the plane fare is to India, it won't kill you to get ripped off for a buck or so here or there.",
      "I am going to North India next month, Anxious but also excited",
      "So I guess you are walking around with a camera or selfie stick filming places and people without asking for their consent but if someone is excited and wants to take a selfie with you, you feel repulsed and like an animal? Did I get this right? You're a dickhead",
      "I pretty much agree on everything that you have pointed out. Garbage is one thing we really want to contain but going clueless probably.\n\nWant to mention about one con. That is about people intimidating foreigners. It is not any culture here, its just the education among the masses is still pretty low. If you come down south this intimidation is pretty much non existant because of better education, exposure to foreign people who travel here for businesses. But in north its different and really cannot help with it immediately. Hopefully it will get better over the period of time. Even in north the general middle class population dont intimidate foreigners.",
      "India sounds terrible",
      "the  garbage u said people put in water was   garland and offerings to god. in india if u offer garland to god .. once u remove that flower garland u  put it in river or water body. thats what u must have seen ppl doing and enjoying lol. not really a garbage i think.",
      "Sorry but why u there if u dont appriciate ur experience? U seem boring bro=)",
      "My wife and I are about to backpack through India. It helps that she is Bangladeshi and speaks Urdu and Hindi quite well. We've practised many times.....I'll hide behind a tree or building until she gets the price of the rickshaw or train ticket. I then jump out. They always have such a beaten look on their face but always laugh with us.",
      "You're a little bit¢h! Harden the fxck up! omfg! they want to be friends and show you of! Oh the trauma you poor little bi¢th!",
      "Wait, people defecate on street? Woo.",
      "You forgot to mention Online Delivery Apps.. Apps like Swiggy, Big Basket, Zomato bring you Food and anything you need once you register. Swiggy has 30 Minute delivery to most Locations in many Cities. So you can order anything anytime.",
      "You forgot to add one more con:  the bodily smells",
      "Give me your parents social where going to scam them.  India looks beautiful except the garbage. I would marry a Indian woman, there so beautiful. I love all Indian food, the spices they use are so aromatic. Except I can't eat goat. But curry chicken is delicious.",
      "Lol, most of your 'pros' were also on your 'cons' list which means there really isn't that many pros 🤷‍♂️. You couldn't pay me to go to India.",
      "Thank you for the warning! does not seem worth it",
      "Con outweighs the pros",
      "Strange questions Indians ask: \n\n- Where is your mother from? \n- Where does your father work? \n- Is your brother married? \n- Have you ever watched Titanic?\n- Did you file your taxes last year? \n- What does it feel like to be white?",
      "Indians don't just dump their trash everywhere only in India. It's pretty much a worldwide cultural thing that they litter and trash up a place no matter where they are or how long they've lived in that country.",
      "Just let them have selfies, it's obviously just a trophy so they can tell their friends how they made good friends with a foreigner, look how wonderful I am, they like me.",
      "Just be careful of any ID theft questions. lol",
      "*DO NOT TRAVEL TO INDIA* All business including hotels, restaurants, taxis and all the tourist places, they all have a very corrupt, dishonest and unfair business practices of double and even triple charging westerners.",
      "The first 12 minutes is the truth. The last 4 minutes are a waste of time.",
      "I don't think you realize how funny this video is.",
      "인도 가보고 싶은데 다들 위험하다고 해서 못가고 있어요😭😭",
      "After watching your video, I think I will pass on India.",
      "I am sorry for the issues faced by this traveler ,Unfortunately people some times goes to very poor areas and oldest and shady parts of the cities and then generalize for the whole country , which is not an accurate assessment, as far as convenience is concerned now  in india we have Apps and websites to get any service at the click of a button, any service like bus, train, hotel, airlines, food, restaurant, intercity transport all can be done online, even in terms of digital transactions india did 43 billion digital transactions in 2021 alone , you won't need cash for transactions in most parts of the urban areas. but people don't want to do any research and some blame also falls on our travel tourism authorities to not inform travelers no proper signage etc.\r\nIf you look india from my perspective it is one of the oldest civilizations in the world, India is a mosaic of multicultural experiences. With a rich heritage and myriad attractions, the country is among the most popular tourist destinations in the world. It covers an area of 32, 87,263 sq. km, extending from the snow-covered Himalayan heights to the tropical rain forests of the south, which give the country a distinct geographical entity.\r\nFringed by the Great Himalayas in the north, it stretches southwards and at the Tropic of Cancer, tapers off into the Indian Ocean between the Bay of Bengal on the east and the Arabian Sea on the west. \r\nIndia has 2400 KMs of himalayan mountain ranges, 7500 KM of coastline with some average , but some beautiful and stunning beaches , india has around 13000 islands , it has a Desert(Thar) and the  place with most rainfall in the world is also in india(Assam), it has a number of huge national park and wild life sanctuaries with rare animals and species which includes the majestic Royal Bengal Tiger, Asiatic lions , Rhino's, elephants , bears etc. Different types of flora and fauna , it has gift of spectacular ancient architecture with thousand of years old temples and cities , also upcoming  modern architecture, India's infrastructure is growing at a scale which is highest in the world , 27 cities now have metro trains or work in progress .with the highest GDP growth among major economies, india is transforming rapidly\r\nAs you travel the expanse of the country, you are greeted by diverse nuances of cuisines, faiths, arts, crafts, music, nature, lands, tribes, history and adventure sports. India has a mesmeric conflation of the old and the new. As the bustling old bazaars rub shoulders with swanky shopping malls, and majestic monuments accompany luxurious heritage hotels, the quintessential traveller can get the best of both worlds. Head to the mountains, enjoy a beach retreat or cruise through the golden Thar, India has options galore for all.",
      "looking forward to coming June to start my vlog journey found your video most helpful bro 💯♥️",
      "On you with the garbage problem. But about animals - I think we should let nature do what they want, it is our entitlement that we feel the need to keep nature away, I think it shouldn't be an issue. I'm perfectly happy with animals roaming around and do what they want, it is their right after all :)",
      "Thanks for all the info. I am planning a trip to India this fall. I want to get off the beaten path, do you have any recommendations of sights to see that are not so crowded with tourists? I am still early in the planning process, but from what I’ve seen I think I want to explore northern india and Rajasthan. Again, great video!",
      "I love India, been so many amazing parts of the country. However, India does wear you down. For me, it's the traffic and the endless high pitched honking, for the love of god bring ear plugs if you visit! Crossing the streets is exhilarating at first but scary and exhausting after a few days. India is the kind of place you visit when you're young, the older you get, the harder it is to go with the flow and cope. Maybe I can fit one more trip in before I reach my mid-40s and just can't deal with it all anymore. That said, my god India is an incredible experience!",
      "I agree with some points . Love from India ❤️👍",
      "Being Indian even I hate garbage all around",
      "Thank you Brock",
      "I can't forget it",
      "So. Um. Did u get to see anyone shit in a hole 🕳 in the yard there",
      "Usually, the cons of traveling abroad are trivial but your list has solid dealbreakers.",
      "As Indian I agree with all the cons \nWe really need to work on ourselves and country. 🤦‍♂️",
      "I been 17 times in India,but I never had any problems,they May try,but It didin't work much",
      "Not my perspective bud, I find your reactions repulsive. Lighten up. 07:22 I went to a milk shop and bought some milk and again the next day he charged me less the second time because he gave me the wrong change the day before. At least five times vendors gave free product because they had no change or was trying to be nice to a foreigner.",
      "India is one third of USA in size.   You going some corner of India and claiming that as India - is ignorance!  Next time come to my hometown Chennai and post a video.  I may fail in little unclean but not as bad as what you are telling!",
      "Very honest and legit cons in India. It really makes a tourist feel awkward. Can only imagine what female tourists would feel!",
      "New Sub bro",
      "All of what you said about India is true",
      "nah man i completely agree. I'm an indian living in australia and having both perspectives really opens me up to the flaws (and lovely aspects) of India. There are so many things that no one seems to be doing anything about...",
      "Aint enough pro's in the world to convince me to go after you mentioned the fly's and car dust on the food.",
      "well i recognized that other ppl around the world they like to take pictures of tourist. Say like Korea when a black person goes they surround them and take pictures of them and touch lolll",
      "Man. You are like Karl Rock on crack . Talk about extremes and storms in tea cups . Apart from the Rubbish issue (not on every state ) you are dramatising small issues .\nIf you cant get a plane/train ticket then ask hotel to book it online for you . Sim card in 15 minutes available at major airports . People Pooing in streets is rare .. peeing in corners is no different from western countries . Simply haggle your rickshaw price or use uber if available. So many Selfies are because if you are vlogging  people think you are famous .. not because you are white.. only 5-10% of shops/restaurants cheat you in cities ..not 50%. Simple carry smaller notes at all timrs . Break down bigger notes at museums etc. . Say no assertively to unwanted touts and dont leave gaps in queues.if somebodypushes in , tell them no. The weak get eaten in India .. If you do your homework before travelling all will be fine ...dont listen to this guy whinging on.. its not as bad as he makes it look.",
      "That's was true review for cons ..but india is spicy nation and it must be tasted ..that's fact isn't it????",
      "When you pay for the poverty tourism , you get crappy service, it's like someone going to LA n harping about skid row . Reality - SIM cards are available at the international airports , buy them and get an IRCTC account to book trains, use OLA , Uber and metro trains instead of Auto rickshaw , Avoid sketchy neighbourhoods , like one would avoid faihill in philli .. importantly stay in hotels n hostels with at least 25 good reviews.. it's common sense travelling . And importantly eat at decent looking restaurants or the ones with good reviews n drink bottled water.. I had my laptop stolen in Valencia , purse in Barcelona , with people coming up to me trying get money while pretending to be helpful, there are crappy places everywhere but if you wanna go by paying bare minimum the experience won't be pleasant  neither a real reflection of the place.and that's true for everywhere ..",
      "I think you have a special and fantastic ability of barging into difficulties and then consider them cons of travelling in India.",
      "It may happen in one or two places all over India",
      "which city are you in here ?? I'm going to India soon and mostly staying in the Himalayas but I wanna spend a few days somewhere else. preferably with random animals all around!! pls help me find a place lol",
      "Good info!! Thanks for the honesty.",
      "It's   the indian perception that's. Western cities are paved cherries and honey.  Ignorant souls. Not knowing what it is to earn one pound in London.  I was there as a visitor. In April.",
      "Look if you are going to India and expecting it to be America , then you are better off just staying in your own country , you seem puzzled they dont act like Americans , I spent 6 months in India and automatically adapted to their standards attitudes etc , go with an open mind not a closed mind , all this video does is bitch about the country",
      "Actually regarding the \"dirt\" part in my opinion the answer is far more nuanced and complex than what many people think. During Indias Independece movement Inda was a very very poor country with only 12% literacy rate. The freedom movement was led by a small group of elite class including nehru and all.  Hence political unity was something which we never had as people. It was more like a collection of regions forming india. Now you wonder how is that related to garbage. Well, if people don't have a sense of patriotism or political identity as indian then it's quite natural they will not care about their surroundings. The south seems better because it has lesser population. But the sad reality is we as a nation especially the lower class(sometimes even the upper first) have not associated ourselves as indian first. We always see ourselves as tamil first or Malayali first. I know the word \"nationalism\" has a very negative connotation in the west especially Europe due to the two world wars but in a developing country like india which is so vast and so divided on language and religion a little bit of nationalism is needed for  political unity. I'm not trying to justify anything but this is my opinion on why we have this garbage problem and why it's so profound.",
      "so funny",
      "I am an Indian and after living in Europe I understand one thing India needs tons of Garbage Cans almost in every corner of the city.",
      "Fuck that, that's too much of a clusterfuck to me.",
      "those questions are not repulsive, the west is just full of snowflakes and liberals",
      "12 mins cons 4 mins pros lol",
      "I'm sorry - but pouring your rubbish off a bridge into a body of water is absolutely F'd",
      "complaining about some really inconvenient stuff stopped listening after you brought the selfies up. smh your backpacking....",
      "Thanks for the  research",
      "You actually can get a Vodafone sim card, you just need to show them an official id so they can register the number in your name. I've bought it when I traveled there like years ago.",
      "ok we can work on these things nothing wrong in the video",
      "fantastic 🥰🥰🥰",
      "Thanks for this video. It was very educational. It allows us to have better expectations and preparation. What are your thoughts on family traveling with children?",
      "3:16 tbh that sounds like acount security questions",
      "This was a great video.\n\nHas anyone been to India since the Covid pandemic started? What’s life like on the ground now compared to the above?",
      "use uber / ola .and online app for ticket.",
      "I feel really ignorant saying this but like how hard is it to put rubbish in a bin",
      "do you speak the language?",
      "Great vid is it safe to drink the tea because of the water?",
      "Do Indie jsem se vždycky chtěla podívat!",
      "Always trust everyone to do what is best for them.",
      "Wow we need to get together to help make a change!",
      "I spent 3 weeks in india touring around just before the virus started , we had photos taken everywhere we went , it is something you just have to accept , it was a bit like being famous , it certainly was an experience",
      "Cons = the place absolutely stinks",
      "Cringe",
      "The irony that you are wearing a t-shirt with the quote \"Real culture is found outside of the tourist areas\"!\nIt is also quite heinous that you have \"loved\" a comment that says that the people \"bothering and cheating\" you are \"from the bottom of the list\",  like the people at the top are not \"bothering and cheating\" their own people.",
      "Well, loved the vid., But quite disappointed by the cons. That's none of your fault. The cons nearly made 70% of your video, although you try to congest. Hope I'd see another vid. next time, that your experience would make the cons to some 30%.☺️",
      "1) Use rideshares like Uber or Ola. Super cheap. \n2) Get sims from the airport, Airtel will do the paperwork for you. The charge a little extra for that. Around 10 USD for 84 days sim. \n3) Use cleartrip.com, 12go.asia, or \"trainticketplease\" by Raj to book trains in India",
      "How people litter garbage is truly revolting...i want to visit India but i couldn't handle that.",
      "Lmao \"I love india, but everyone shits in the street and it is filthy\"",
      "Agree with most of your points except the for the 'getting hassled on the streets' one.  This is a more of a pro than a con in my opinion... you can walk down one road and by the time you reach the end of it, you've met 20 new people, had 4 cups of masala chai, chatted about life/politics/food culture and all while  getting a chance to practice some Hindi.  For this reason alone, it's impossible to be bored in India.\n\nAnd I've never seen one of these foreigner train stations you spoke about???",
      "Is it true that there are no maps or street signs in India? Sorry if this sounds dumb to ask but I heard that pulling up google maps like you would in the U.S. is completely pointless in India which I imagine then it is easy to get lost",
      "When is the best time to visit India?!",
      "India has always been somewhere where I would like to go but the cons you display can stop a lot of people sadly. In reality, every country or place will have cons, but knowing how to navigate them is key. I am from Chicago and know it is extremely high in crime but you just learn where to go or not too or if you’re in a bad area, you just use caution. Can’t wait to visit India, any advice anyone?!",
      "Indians know all the people at least in their village..  That's their culture. A marriage party in India not merely a party but a celebration where the entire villagers take part. And cremation also be with the presents all the people.. That's a different cultures where they try to know each and every person they meet..",
      "4:06 I’m laughing so loud that it’s 2:25 am and my brother woke up 🤣🤣🤣",
      "Would love to be accepted to pee on the street in the place where I live😜",
      "As a tourist , I have been to many cities in India and when I have purchased many packaged food products , bottled drinks  or other items  , I have always been charged the correct amount and been given the correct change \nWhen I used the multi hire rickshaw to go about 1 or 2 kilometres on many occasions , the fare was only 7 rupees  , which is about 20 cents and when I gave the drivers 20 rupees and I didn't need the change , they would  follow me and make me take the change \nAgree about the rubbish , it needs a plan to clean it up ,  such as a price on it so the poor can collect it and make some money . the dogs are a big problem for me  , they would bark and follow me and try to attack  me  and I don't want rabies  also have been to many hotels to stay and  I have had many problems with no hot water or only hot water around 2 hours a day or  often , the water supply was off for most of the day and 24 hour water is a essential service  as it makes it very difficult without water for the toilet or to use the taps for cleaning .",
      "Garbage is really a problem.  Very true review.",
      "Hey shut your mouth your country isn't clean",
      "No one:\nIndia: stop light Indians:beep intensifies",

      "‘I love india, just because there’s cons doesn’t mean I don’t like india, I love it there. But anyway let’s start with the cons, number one, this place fucking sucks’",
      "You are the most of person from the Jupiter 👽 because you don't know in the world no perfect country! \nOne more thing culture different and also middle class country. \nAnd you always make videos on garbage and prices how much cost and some of cheating people with your, no English!! Better than don't travel no country .",
      "Bro come visit Sri Lanka 🇱🇰",
      "love from India....sincerely apologies for the cons..agreed on most of them. Don't want to hide our  faults under  the blanket of culture , diversity or something  else . yes problems are their but as a society we are in the phase of transition,  its a NEW India people are changing over here gradually  but Don't let anything hold u back from visiting  here again . want so see more of U....",
      "I appreciate your sincere enthusiasm for India and travel in general. I also appreciate that you’re not exclusively showing India through rose colored glass. This makes me want to go, but I still am intimidated by India! Sounds very intense!",
      "Lol what’s up with the selfie thing?",
      "India you need anti littering laws lol",
      "Hello. Apologize for bad experiences in North India. If you are coming again to India, please head towards South India such as Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka etc. You wont regret it. It is a different world.",
      "3:52 I immediately thought of an \"Indian version of Johnny Mathis\"! \n\nBut great video, very informative!",
      "When our Indian friends visited UK, she said ' In UK you have dogs waste almost in every side walk & in India we have human waste every where 🙄",

      "Come to newtwn kolkata you will be shocked",
      "U lived in NORTH India for 9 months and you are now generalising  your experience as that of the entire country. Thats not correct. India is a large country . Every region will give you varied experience .  If you have heard of NORTH EAST INDIA which is entitely isolated and different from mainland India kindly spare time to visit. \nLots of regards and best wishes to your channel.",
      "OMG this was great!  and, sooo funny about the selfies!  I want to visit India one day soon-on my bucket list. Thank you so much!",
      "Thanks for the honest video. On the personal questions issue I should say sometimes even we Indians find some of the queries uncomfortable. But as a rule the standards for a question being personal are somewhat different from the West. India is a family centric society, so asking questions about one's family is deemed quite normal (wanting to see your sister's photo is definitely not). If I bring a friend of mine, Indian or not, the very first questions they are gonna face are like \"What's your name?\", \"What's your father's name?\", \"What does he do?\", \" Does your mom work also?\", \" Who else are there in your family?\" and the like. Even, at times people may feel ignored if not asked such questions after being acquainted for the first time. 😆 Here 'living with parents' does not have the disapproving stigma attached to it. Rather, it's the opposite, it's what expected of good, grown-up and caring and responsible children.",

      "I live in India. The trash problem is very frustrating. People have(in general) very less awareness of what they are doing. Public cleanliness is not a part of life for many people. It won't be wrong to say that people are lazy in that regard as many people won't bother to go to throw garbage in the bin even if it is 10 steps away. They just throw it right there on the ground and sometimes in water too. At many places,there's no garbage collection system and hence people are forced to do it. So, government needs to work on that. But what I've noticed traveling around India is that there will be places where you'd not see a piece of trash and you'll find parts of the country very filthy. North is more polluted than the South. West isn't really great when it comes to cleanliness. Northeast is better in that regard. The government has been pushing Swachha Bharat (clean India) mission rigorously through awareness, advertising and all. It has yielded good results but there is a very long way to go. \nI feel cleanliness is a habit. If it becomes a habit, it won't go away.\nThe other cons you mentioned are also largely true. I relate to them as someone who lives here.",
      "I am an Indian and I absolutely agree with all the cons.",
      "Am I the only one that saw the lizard?",
      "Tickets online. Car and train. \nAvoid people. Learn saying no to them... (unnecessary)\nU are right about unhygienic. Food and stuff but u will never forget the test....... We will make our country clean.. Inshaallah..... And keep travel..... One more thing south India is diffrent u shuld try.",
      "Dude they havnt been outside there city. This is the rural area try going to the big cities. or south.",
      "Thanks for the honesty. We are trying to change our ways and hopefuly will be okay 3 to 4 generations.",
      "The temptation is to say \"if you don't like other cultures - stay home\". \nBUT...\nHe's right. Things can annoy even the most worldly traveller after a while.",
      "Since May 2016, you can pay for train trickets on the IRCTC webpage with foreign debit cards. This might not be convenient if you're going to India for months and do not know exactly which day you'll be done at one place and will want to move onto the next. But for me who \"only\" get six weeks of paid vacation from my job every year, I always plan and book train tickets before I go.",
      "My dear friend its india were animal people have share the planet and respect there existances.....gargabe is a problem for a population of 1.3 billion of us we are trying to sort it out ....but surely we are improving.....anyways you are welcome with whole heart....",
      "That selfie thing is just sad! really really sad! We only want selfie with a celebrities bc they are important people. Later we can brag to our friends and family and show them the picture to earn validation. Indian people do this all the time because they consider white as superior. This mindset is a harmful side effect of Colonialization. It saddens me too see this people bleaching and applying steroids cream on their skin just to appear whiter.",
      "Throwing garbage its not our culture ,its our problem.Please dont say its Culture.Welcome to India",
      "I really didn't understand your intentions sir.. A pro & con video where 85 % or more is dedicated to cons! Wow.. And an end sentence or two  as a pro.  \nHow different are you sir from western media? Anyways, that doesn't bother us, hope you have a good time here!\n\nLet the other Vbloggers and youtuber show the better sides of India, if not you :)",

      "Millions of tax payers dollars spent on incredible India destroyed in a 15 min video lol.",
      "I am really sorry for \"cons\" that you have faced. But I think I should point to few of the things. India is a diverse country in every aspect. 1.3 Billion people. Huge class differences are there in terms of money, education, culture. People that are bothering and cheating you are from the bottom of the list, most of the Indians avoid them too. And yes plan your journey properly, you will get app for home delivery of everything, from communication, food, vegetables, medicine etc. Buy train tickets reserved or unreserved from app. Please do not mind, but I have to say this that if you are not on a very tight budget then please book at least AC second class. If you go below that you will continue to get whatever you are already getting. As you are a foreigner your currency is very strong here, though I don't think you have not done any hard work to make your currency stronger, cheaters will try to get advantage of your strong currency. I always see foreigners are saying \"India is So cheap.\" -- it is not, your currency is strong. One more thing, when people are asking you personal question, they have already started judging you, be aware. I am not saying that these problems are not present, they are there. Agreed. Most of us don't like them too. So we stay and go to places where things are better and easy for us.",
      "Everything you have said is true but I have to mention most of them don't really apply to regular tourists. And for traveling and hotels online booking and payments are much appreciated. Avoid tuk tuk Use Uber and Ola. You need to learn to say no to people who ask for selfies and ask unnecessary questions.",
      "Nice 👍🏽",
      "South India is exactly opposite to North India. Most of the cons u discussed is not valid for South India. And the best part is north east india. Love and regards. Peace",
      "👍🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹",
      "I will try to give my pov on each cons:\nGarbage issue: this is going to take a fundamental change in the mentally of the ppl, but I also think authorities haven't done enough to curb this problem, there is no proper waste management system esp in smaller towns and cities, also they need to lay down strict rules and hv heavy fines on culprits, things will change. Same ppl when go to foreign countries follow these rules and don't throw litter outside.\nScams and cons: because of the sheer no. Of ppl here, the no. Of such will always be higher, but I think in % they are low, most of us will always try and help you out.\nStray animals: well this is a cultural thing, can't judge anything keeping Western lenses, like many Indians will find keeping animals in fences and chains is regressive and that they shd be free to roam.\nPersonal space and selfies: I just don't understand the obsession re selfies with foreigners, nut in general if personal space is your thing then this country is not for you. We are very social ppl and it's very common to ask questions like what does my parents do, what do I do for living, I'm married or not. But asking for a pic of your sister is very very weird, even for us. So stay away from such ppl without worrying whether you looking like rude, if you feel awkward, just ignore, don't pay attention.\nSIM cards and train tickets: again the govt and authorities needs to do more for tourism and make these things easy. Though I have watched some vlogs in which ppl hv said it's very easy to get SIM cards at airport and that irctc website accepts international cards, do check vlogs by Ivana Perkovic or Christine Kaaloa.\n\nIn general, India is very diverse country, in one city itself you will find many different kind of ppl. For e.g. in Pune where I live, You will find the cleanest of areas where ppl won't bother you with selfies, ppl displaying pda, girls wearing anything they want and then in other areas you will also find the things you mentioned. It's just up to ppl what they are seeking here and truth of this country is a mix of all these things.",
      "Good video bro. Thanks for sharing. But it seems to me that you're wandering in a lot of poor areas and that's what you seem to be describing for most part. Its like going to ghetto or slums in the US and describing the experience :) agree with the bad garbage ethics though",
      "Uttar Pradesh and Bihar are the most underdeveloped, populated, less literate states of India. I have been to at least 15 states in India. In India, Uttar Pradesh ( Agra) and Bihar are the dirtiest states. Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Punjab are lot cleaner. North East India Sikkim, Meghalaya, Arunachal Pradesh etc are cleaner than North India. Overall South Indian states like Goa, Kerala, Tamil Nadu are much cleaner and people are literate.  In major cities like Delhi, New Delhi is clean and green but Old Delhi is dirty and sketchy. In Mumbai, South Mumbai is cleaner but suburbs are not clean. I  think you are generalising and exaggerating things.  You said people throw garbage in the river. Actually it's not a garbage but flowers and Garlands which they throw. Especially in Temple towns like Varanasi. After Prime Minister Modi launched Clean India Mission the Sanitation coverage in India is over 98%. Overall people have been made aware of cleaneliness. People in major cities have started segregating dry and wet waste.  I would say the older generation was illierate and way dirtier. The current generation is more cleaner and literate.  So it will take another twenty years or a generation more for India to be a cleaner country. As India gets Richer, the government will have more money for waste management but it's the mindset of Indians which needs to be changed.   Cheers from Mumbai",
      "And talking about your #Privacy Indians as you don't know, are generally social very social, so when you feel that your #PRIVACY is getting ruined it's just that people are excited to know more about you that's a good sign they are interested in you.\n\nWe don't live like places which have become so quiet that you can here someone sneezing on the streets. \nWe are social we are loud and even our vehicals make lots of noise. \nIf you don't like it, you have come to wrong place.",
      "Yes there is Garbage but not #so #much #Garbage and Garbage and Garbage everywhere, you haven't traveled India bro, and not everyone does that FYI.",
      "I rely on you to \"suffer\" through all the cons you described in the first 12 minutes of this video as I sit in my recliner and tour India vicariously through you on Youtube, Brock. I can understand now why you can get a 10 year visa.",
      "Sir If u dont like to give more selfies,then say directly no,but dont satnd and keep silent.if they look like weird ,then wont respong to them and try to avoid them..u can say like i have urgent work..so i gotta go..sir i think u r hesitating to say no to them..so learm from experiences..try to say big no to them...otherwise they treat u as a statue..iam sorry u met mostly rude people..but south and north part of india r better than north of india",
      "Well people with less money generally have bigger hearts",
      "Good VID. I needed to see and hear the truth. I might go someday. I don't like the trash,  it i will have to look past it. I saw a lot of trash in Naples and had to figure out some way of enjoying myself. Thanx , from Sacramento",
      "I think you are generalising India by just travelling the north. You will  find that the culture changes in every state. Im assuming you have travelled in UP and Bihar which are the least developed states in India akin to Pakistan in hdi. Don't let that skew your opinion of the whole country.",
      "It will take a generation of social change to cure the garbage problem.",
      "Being a backpacker there are lots of cons as tourists and visitors it will reduce as you can use Ola and uber to travel point A to B and also permanent residents address of there country can also get sim easily.  So being backpacker this are problems.",

      "try to book train tickets online from official railway website it is very easy and convenient",
      "Thanks for the great info - India has been on my \"bucket list\" for a while.  After watching your Cambodia trips we did a backpacking trip thru Cambodia last year...this fall it will probably be India.  Thanks again, keep up the great work :-)",
      "Thanks for talking about it ... Much needed... 70% of Indians need to change ... only 25 to 30% have some manners ..\nCheating in matter of change of money, BIG YES. It sucks. ‘People cheating in the country where they talk much about Karma lessons all the time ...’",
      "Really Interesting video. ✌️",
      "I'm definitely going to visit India someday. Thanks for the info.",

It will also help you learn the customs of the country so you dont offend people....",
