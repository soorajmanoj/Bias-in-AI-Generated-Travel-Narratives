And also, when you starts recording then you notice people tend to be “annoyed” if they are captured in your videos. I see that a lot mostly to NYC vloggers when they do a vlog and capture other people and the reaction is just.. you know. That’s why i am curious how you get the confidence. I would definitely be definitely shy about it..",

I get bullied by the customers then the manager stands behind me while I work, and  get treated like a child.  I’m forty years old.  The government is stalking me and controlling my income and I don’t make enough money to leave the state.  I’m being held here against my own free will.  I just wish I had an opportunity in life where I can make money, have choices, and be respected.  On Long Island the people in control call us “slaves”.  They do this in New York where they want us to burn, calling us slaves telling us to be strong and to hurt everyone.  I need help and nobody sees the problem cause they are brainwashed.🐇  Somebody help me.",

It looked the perfect size for what I am looking for. Normally these types of machines where you grind the beans and then pull your own shot with the Lever are quite big. This looks perfect. I really want to get one of these but in this size with just the basic coffee types. Do you recommend it? I live in England but visit New York every two years. Love it.

I see resemblances in so many things: The intention to end the student frugal lifestyle because of the first really well paying job, the feeling of freedom and spontaneity (that is especially present when spring is around the corner) and so on. Life sometimes just feels like  being finally allowed to reap the fruits of one's labour. Although I have a different career path (I am a post-doc academic) and live in a different country, your vlogs really resonate with me.",

The Bridge he build in Bilbao is famous because its made of \"glass\" in one of the most rainy cities in Spain so people were getting injured. It has a carpet now...and I could go on.

You really couldn't see much cos they were in the middle of building the memorial and One World Trade. My friend I stayed with and I saw it from an overlook window in the then newly-reopened WTC Building 7. You really can't get a grip on how HUGE those towers were until you see their footprints!

Not all places are dirty. But definitely there's problem with the attitude in India's Hindi speaking regions. They're in a delusional bubble not accepting criticism. Why not teach the people of northern regions to be civic?\nThere's a lot of migrant workers from north to south polluting and pooping on railways track, bus stations etc. I can't even relate to the places in south I remember 15 years back.\nNow it's garbage everywhere, r@ping, robbing and running their own regions where rhe police can't track who's coming inside the regions in south.\nDespite having twice the size of land compared to south, they have one major city for growth and that is Delhi which is way polluted compared any part of India. Lack of education and civic sense is major issue to northerners. See how modest and clean north east people are you'll be amazed. \nFirst correct your mistakes if you don't want westerns to insult you.",

      "11:52 Americans and Europeans forgot that when their ancestors were still practising hunting, India had already established a university at Nalanda. Their countries have worse living standards. There are so many faults with USA!\n \n• Homeless people are rampant in places like NYC. They like to excrete in public places which presents sanity issues, and nothing has been done to deal with the problem of homeless people just because of capitalism. Yet most Americans like to call out us Indians for having poor hygiene conditions.\n\n• Marriages in USA are done only because of wealth of the partner and they may take divorce anytime, the children have to suffer and have to be raised by single parents. While in India, marriages are treated as special bonds not just between two partners but their families too and are deep rooted into culture. Americans lack heritage like us Indians do.\n\n• School, a place where children spend half their lives, is the most unsafe place in USA. Everyday, so many children lose their lives in school shootings. Granted they have fast response teams, but prevention is always better than cure.\n\n• moreover, USA is simply not safe for Indians. Indians have to suffer racism there. Recently, a case was there in which an Indian student was run over by police officers who seemingly commented afterwards that her life was not worth much. Similarly, another Indian student was killed in a gang robbery.\n\n• Mafia runs rampant in the country. Politics there is completely controlled by Mafia. Gang wars break out and we all know that USA and Canada are terrorist havens. GTA games may be fiction but damn do the games' stories show the reality of the Americans lives so accurately!\n\nYet, American media shows that India is filthy and polluted. Right now a lot of pollution may be caused because of India and China, but a lot of it had been done because of the industrial revolution in Europe and America. They completed their development when we were kept colonialised and now when we are trying to develop and flourish, they are calling us out for pollution? Wah re public! Granted we have to accept criticism but This is not criticism, this is insult.",

Vidhesis want to see the real india and show it to the back hiome, why they need to show the wannabe parts that we ape from thier countries only, Best example, the glass building, built for cold countries so that more sunlight can be absorbed, for us its simply means heavier load on AC.

They will show the smallest of things to get likes and views from India.\n\nBut, the problem is with our own people as well. The young Indians in this video were taking pictures with ordinary foreigners as if they're celebrities or something. A guy charged INR 1500 for a head massage, which is scamming. We have to discipline our people as well.\n\nPutting this aside, this video was one of the best satirical videos I've seen. You really roasted them badly. Good job.",

      "5 Reasons Why India Is the Dirtiest and the Most Polluted Country in The World\n\nWhat is the first thing that comes to your mind when you hear India? Most people will answer cows, toilets, Bollywood, the Taj Mahal, and high rape rates.\n\nAll these assessments are not wrong, considering that this country, which is located at the South Asian region has more negative sides than positive sides.\n\nIndia is known as a backward and outdated country. Its social problems are very complex.\n\nApart from the issue of rape, most parts of India are slums, which impress people from all over the world, that they are filthy and dirty. This is also proven by surveys from various research institutions which place India at the top of the list of the dirtiest countries with the highest levels of pollutants in the world.\n\n5 reasons India is the most polluted country\n\n1. Poverty\n\nIndia often boasts about its rapid economic development, but a survey by the Rangarajan Committee shows that more than 38% of the population live below the poverty line in 2023.\n\nWith great poverty, most residents live in inappropriate places such as riverbanks, slums.\n\n2. Density\n\nIndia is one of the most densely populated countries in the world with very limited natural resources compared to its booming population. Its population reaches 1.4 billion.\n\nPoverty and density are the 'right' combination to create a slum and polluted environmental situation. Garbage, human waste, animal waste is strewn everywhere on the streets of India, the large number of vehicles and related things certainly make India look so dirty and filthy.\n\n3. Don't care about the surrounding environment\n\nThere is an interesting fact from the primitive lifestyle of Indians. They tend not to care about the surrounding environment.\nThis is because Indians think that public facilities are the responsibility of other people, especially the government. So even though a lot of rubbish has piled up, even though it disturbs the view and causes an unpleasant smell, it's all left alone. Even though outsiders think this is very sad, Indians, whose mindset is backward and uncivilized, have become accustomed to this situation.\n\n4. Caste Mentality\n\nIt is common knowledge that Indian society, which is predominantly Hindu, knows caste in their life. Because of these social norms, people who feel they belong to a higher class tend not to want to do work that is identical to that of people from the strata below them.\n\n5. Government Services\n\nIndia is a very poor country. This results in minimal government services and attention to environmental issues. Such as widening waterways, emptying trash cans and so on.",

Their foreign policies and defence policies are decided and controlled by the USA.\nOn the other hand, we are a successful nuclear power, not an NPT signatory, successful missile program, 4th largest and strongest defence power, a successful space program, 5th largest economy and going to be 3rd largest by the end of this decade, a successful IT Industry and much more.

EVERY single country has their own issues and stupid people to deal with. We can't really change their end image of us but we can do better in providing good hospitality and behave NORMALLY with them. Many would ignore but we Indians actually have an obsession or superiority complex for foreigners and it NEEDS to be fixed. EVERY single person of any country should remember the fact that you represent your country, family, culture and upbringing. Focus on yourself first, be good and aim for becoming an asset - the country will automatically progress. NO DOUBT OR SECOND THOUGHTS !",

      "I agree that a lot of vloggers show slums and random streets of India but the villages and random street are what make 90% of India. The cleanliness that you are talking about is still limited to posh areas that are either close to a IT hub or an international Airport to impress foreigners who have just landed in India. I've been to Mumbai and I saw huge heaps of dust and garbage at a lot of places and found cleanliness only at select sports, even marine drive was pretty dirty which is a massive tourist attraction. I don't blame these guys for showing \"dirt and garbage\" as it is actually real India and makes literally more than 90% of the country.",

One is that there are no public waste disposal bins on the streets, making it impossible to dispose of waste properly. Additionally, people, mostly the elderly, spit on public roads. I wish there were strict laws to prevent this behavior. Whenever I buy a snack, I keep the wrapper inside my bag or pocket and dispose of it when I reach home. That's all I can do.",

As a result of not having a roof over their heads or stealing food out of desperation, many ended themselves in jail or deported.\n\nEvery night, police patrol the streets looking for undocumented immigrants and homeless individuals.

It is very, very different from the rest of the country. It is exceptionally clean, with great weather and friendly people who can speak English wherever you go. Most of the rest of India is dirty, chaotic and polluted - exactly as Janine thought it would be.\n\nAlso, it's quite sad that they didn't do much research into Kerala - because it has a Christian population of almost 30% in the state, and that's why you see many churches. \n\nSo please, don't think entire India is going to be like this. Kerala is a highly sought-after destination for both domestic and international tourists, and that's why it looks like this. Research before you go. Cheers!",
