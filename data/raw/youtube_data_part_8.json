      "Hard to believe these are really indians in this video. They are unrecognizable with the kindness they showed white foreigners. Indians get so stupid when they see a white person. Like they might never get use to seeing white foreigners. No wonder it was so easy to invade India throughout it's history. Indian men can't think sensible. Who cares if white people likes Indian food. Indians don't have to act like foolish inferior ass even when white people gets chatty. If only Indians treat their own with the same friendliness and kindness. India would be a better place. How is it Indians can be kind and accepting except to their own. It not like the white people who like to run off there to India don't know this about them. That's why they aim at running to India so Indians can make them feel and be treated exclusively like they are some white God. Indians need to seriously work on their so-called over friendliness of strangers/foreigners especially ones of the white/caucasian kind. When Indians go to their country, they treat them like side kicks. When they are friendly with Indian men, it's only because they want them to choose their white women to be with Indian men. Indian men can't be that stupid to not know that! The white race have no regard for the non white races of the world. So stop wasting your time, energy and DNA on them!

      "see that old man from who you bought a bottle for 20 Rupees? that's how we handle money (reposting my comment on tea coffee short)\nPeople don't hand money like that. Some urban people who grew away from the culture may do that. But in the sub-continent, money, an important facilitator of life, should be treated with more respect. Hand it more like holding with max fingers as possible. More like the yoga hand posture/chef's kiss hand, but the fingers are more in contact with the currency and not just the fingertips. Ik it's a weird way to explain😹. But yeah, it's a subconscious way in which elders identify spoilt brats (the way they handle valuables). Also, you must notice, the South Indian (at least the old ones) vendors would never put the money (change)/receipt on the counter. They make sure to give it into your hands. This is mostly lost in the north India due to frequent invasions and dilution of culture induced traditions and integrity >>sorry for being so persistent with this issue..<<",

In between, you are not supposed to eat anything. You can drink water. Suppose you have the habit of eating something with tea, little snacks, that is not allowed. The snacks too you can have while having your lunch or dinner. The doctor says : You must give some time for your digestion system to relax. If you have dinner at 8 PM regularly,by 10.30 PM you can go to bed to Sleep.2 and half hours for the digestion system to work before you go to sleep.

So when you travel alone you should before read all information about it and you won't have problem.

Regular Delhi streets are not for exploration. I saw this video and the footage mostly shows really shady locations that are not tourist popular.

      "Why India is Becoming a Nightmare for Tourists, While Pakistan Stands as a Better Alternative\n\nIn recent years, India’s reputation as a tourist destination has been rapidly declining. Once promoted as a land of culture and diversity, it is now being described by many international visitors as a nightmare — even for Americans, Europeans, and other foreign travelers. The experiences shared by tourists paint a grim picture: constant harassment, unsafe environments, scams, and alarming crime rates.\n\nGrowing Safety Concerns in India\n\nTourists in India often face harassment from locals. Reports of theft in hotels, aggressive begging for food and money, and frequent scams are widely documented. Beyond these issues, the situation becomes even more alarming with the recurring incidents of sexual assault. Hundreds of reported cases, including horrifying gang rapes of female tourists, have made global headlines. Such incidents have raised serious questions about safety and respect for foreigners in the country.\n\nA Negative Tourist Experience\n\nMany travelers complain that India feels dirty, polluted, and filled with unpleasant smells. Instead of being able to enjoy the history or culture, tourists often find themselves battling discomfort, anxiety, and fear. Stories of cheap, unethical behavior — from overcharging to tricking unsuspecting visitors — are too common. For many foreign guests, the overall experience leaves them with regret rather than fond memories.\n\nPakistan: A Striking Contrast\n\nIn sharp contrast, Pakistan is gaining recognition as a safe, welcoming, and genuinely hospitable country. Tourists arriving in Pakistan often experience an opposite reality compared to India. Instead of harassment, they are met with kindness and generosity. Many visitors share stories of Pakistanis refusing to take money for food or services, offering free meals and even free accommodation.\n\nPakistani people are calm, loving, caring, down-to-earth, and deeply respectful towards guests. Safety concerns are minimal, and international travelers often remark on how secure they feel compared to other countries in the region.\n\nNatural Beauty and Warm Hospitality\n\nPakistan is not just safe but also breathtakingly beautiful. From the majestic mountains of the north to the cultural richness of its cities, Pakistan offers everything a tourist could want without the fear and discomfort often reported in India. Another highlight that surprises visitors is the natural beauty of Pakistani people themselves, with many foreigners noting how strikingly attractive and graceful the locals are.\n\nConclusion\n\nWhile India struggles with a growing reputation of being unsafe, dirty, and hostile for foreign visitors, Pakistan shines as a rising star in tourism. Its warm hospitality, safety, generosity, and unmatched beauty make it a far better destination for travelers seeking authentic and respectful cultural experiences. For many tourists, the choice is becoming clearer: India may be a nightmare, but Pakistan is a dream.",

      "I also have a story I want to share\n\nI had a bad experience in India during a long holiday two years ago. My father and I went there with our extended family for a vacation. When we arrived, everything went as usual. We visited many beautiful places and enjoyed our trip\nAfter finishing the day’s activities, we returned to the villa. However, I, along with some of my cousins—2 boys and 4 girls—decided to walk around an area near the villa that we hadn’t explored before\nWhen we reached what looked like a small village, we came across a group of teenagers on motorcycles who were hanging out. Suddenly, one of them started catcalling my cousin. We ignored it and kept walking. Not long after, we heard shouting from behind us\nWhen we turned around, we saw the same group of teenagers riding towards us. We stopped, curious about what they wanted. One of them spoke in English, asking where we stayed, saying that they wanted to \"send us back after we finished exploring.\" I politely refused, not wanting to trouble them\nBut then, one of the boys suddenly got off his motorcycle and grabbed my female cousin’s hand, saying, “Come with us, it’ll be fun.” My cousin told him to let go, but they kept insisting and trying to force her. I stepped in and told him firmly to release her\nThat only made things worse. They looked unhappy, spoke in a language I didn’t understand, and it seemed like they wanted to fight. There were about 4 to 5 of them. Several got off their bikes and looked ready to attack us, especially the boys in our group\nLuckily, my cousins and I had some martial arts training. One of my cousins, who was 20 at the time, was especially skilled—he had won three gold medals in silat competitions since his father was a silat master. A fight broke out on the street\nAt one point, my cousin managed to punch one of them in the solar plexus, leaving him almost fainting and struggling to breathe. Thankfully, no weapons were involved, just barehanded fighting. In the end, we all came out okay, though some of us had minor injuries and bruises\nBy the time Maghrib (dusk) approached, we decided to head back to the villa. When we arrived, our family noticed something was wrong—our clothes were dirty, and my face was swollen near the eye. We explained what had happened. They were worried, but also relieved that we knew how to defend ourselves.\nAfter that, the rest of the week went smoothly, and we enjoyed our stay at the villa. Only the first day was tense because of that incident\n\n\nNote: \n\n“Sorry if my writing isn’t very formal, but I just wanted to share my experience. This story is not meant to put down any country, it’s simply for sharing.”",

And also there are cops who do their work (they don't take it lightly ,if you had an accident,they won't trust anyone , instead they will take you to the hospital themselves). There are many good hospitals in Mumbai and the local people have manners . You should 've visited Mumbai , BUT I RECOMMEND ALL THE TOURISTS NOT TO VISIT INDIA. 🙏🏻",

I feel very sorry for this girl, but one thing I would like to say to any foreigner wanting to visit India, never ever always stay be in new Delhi. It isn't necessary and is pretty crowded too as for the fact you see the little kids begging for money, you will find that outside of any  railway stations. For the foreigners, try other places, there are a lot of places with ppl with good behaviour, civic sense. delhi is not always a place where u would wanna stay 24/7 and I m shameful of saying that😭\nIndia has good people but in good areas. Do not roam around a area which is literally fullllll of markets, houses and stuff like that. People need not sit at a open dhaba in india there are places where there are a lot of fancy restaurants and building and houses and hotels.\n\nSO WHAT I M TRYING TO SYA IS NEVER EVER TRY TO STAY AT DELHI AT ALL COST OR U MIGHT OR U WILL NEVER WANNA COME TO INDIA AGAIN....\n\nAnd also, don't come with that \"smiling, happy, innocent\" face when ur around these annoying areas especially.

While most real Indians are very kind and welcoming, there are always some infiltrators or criminals disguised as beggars who may try to loot you. That’s why I strongly advise avoiding beggars, using only trusted cabs instead of local autos, and researching safer parts of cities or villages before visiting. Miscreants can be found everywhere, so staying alert is important. For female travelers, whether Indian or foreign, it is always safer to travel with a male companion such as a close friend or family member.”",

Being a girl and someone who looks very different from the mainstream idea of Indians, and often regarded to as 'Chinese' despite being an Indian, it's likely the one of the most dangerous places for some of us to visit, especially with the harrasment and constant bickering. India is a beautiful country and most of it's people too are beautiful in every way possible but there are a few bunch who are rotten to the core and bc to them the whole country is looked down upon.\nBe in northeast or mainstream India, I've seen my fair share of entitled, rude and overall disgusting people but it doesn't mean the entire country is bad.\nBut one thing is for sure, India is not safe, especially for girls and if you look different it's a cherry on top of that. In my area their have been cases of guys targeting girls and even a few rape cases and bc of that I can't even leave the house without a pocket knife or scissors.\n India really is a beautiful place but it's also sometimes the most scary place to be",

Travel etiquette 101: you don’t just wander alone through unfamiliar streets in a place you’ve never been and then act shocked when things dont go the way you expected them to, miss gurl basic survival skills matter more than just walking around.\nAnd to add onto what the comments have been saying, imagine thinking a country of 1.4 billion people is ‘not worth traveling to’ just because someone only filmed the corners that made them uncomfortable. India isn’t a theme park curated for foreigners, it’s a living, breathing country.\nI recently moved to India permanently, and even before that I visited frequently and while I’ve seen similar situations happen to others, its never happened to me.

      "Ich bin ein 19-jähriger Deutscher und habe letzten Monat Mumbai mit meinem indischen Freund besucht, um die berühmten Märkte und die lebendigen Straßen der Stadt zu erkunden. Eines Abends gegen 21 Uhr warteten wir in der Nähe des Bahnhofs auf ein Taxi, als plötzlich drei Männer auf mich zukamen und nach dem Weg fragten. Bevor ich reagieren konnte, griffen sie meinen Rucksack und rannten davon.\nIch versuchte, ihnen nachzulaufen, merkte aber schnell, dass ich allein an einem fremden Ort ohne Handy oder Geld war. Verängstigt ging ich zur nächsten Polizeistation, um den Diebstahl zu melden und hoffte auf Unterstützung. Zu meinem Entsetzen hörten die Beamten kaum zu und sagten, sie seien zu beschäftigt, um zu helfen.\nDiese fehlende Unterstützung war herzzerreißend. In Deutschland behandeln die Polizisten Touristen mit Fürsorge und Dringlichkeit, aber hier fühlte ich mich unsichtbar. Dieses Erlebnis ließ mich verletzlich und unsicher zurück.\nIch werde nicht nach Indien zurückkehren, bis es echte Veränderungen gibt, um Besucher zu schützen. Wenn ich, ein 19-Jähriger aus Deutschland, angegriffen und ignoriert werden kann, stellen Sie sich die Risiken für Frauen oder alleinreisende Personen vor.\nMein Rat: Seien Sie immer vorsichtig und stellen Sie Ihre Sicherheit über den Sightseeing-Spaß.",

I DO NOT SUPPORT ANY INHUMANE BEHAVIOR. I do remember that I once had seen an Indian man being belittled all because of the fact that he is of Indian origin and surprisingly his wife happens to be Korean and as the story goes that the man wanted to have his known people to enjoy Korean Night Life but unfortuantely they were not given permission to enter the club premises and it had caused rage in the man to be erupted and we as viewers can clearly see that he and the Korean man are having verbal altercation. It is a known fact that as an international traveller, one should be aware of any unpleasant situation that can happen. Some foreigners also deliberately post videos of the unclean places in India so to create an image of a Dirty Country, but every Country has its own ups and downs and irrespective of the fact that such things do take place, it does not necessarily affect the mindset of some good travellers, and they do have an amazing time in our Country.  \n\nBelow are the links for the mentioned topics:-\n(1) KOREAN CLUBS HATE INDIA 🇮🇳 || VIDEO PROOF|| WHY INDIANS ARE NOT ALLOWED ?\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR9ZrMRCOVA\n\n(2) SLAYY POINT - How Foreigners Show India REACTION!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b14VcSbLmao\n\n(3) Reality of KOREA | Racism, BTS Army Scam and Unknown SECRETS!

In India, we say ‘Atithi Devo Bhava’—the guest is god—and we honor guests accordingly. Though I’m Hindu, I’m not Indian by nationality. I lived in Chennai for many years as a student, and I deeply respect you as a foreign woman.\n\nI recognize that in countries like the USA or EU, most places seem safe, but when traveling to a place with different cultures and languages, the risks can increase. It’s always prudent not to visit alone in unfamiliar areas, especially if local norms or preferences might lead to misunderstandings.\n\nFrom what I saw, your video was filmed by someone else, with clips of hugging or being chased—suggesting you didn’t go alone or had no consent to include those scenes. It feels like the video was created intentionally to highlight India’s drawbacks without showing the kindness and safety that many people here offer.\n\nIf you believe everyone is good in your home country—why so much reliance on policing and intelligence? Women everywhere deserve safety, especially in transit systems like subways.

I told him there is no need as my vehicle drove off, but to my surprise, he kept chasing our vehicle on his little tricycle, insisting that he should repay me.

      "If she would came to Pakistan, everyone would respect her in everyway as they normally do to foreigners and tourists, our Pakistani nation is not like India's. In my religion(ISLAM), it is taught to respect women, elders and youngers both equally making every Muslim feeling proud of their religion, it is not optional but it is obligatory also it is written in pakistani law that all women and females have every right to be safe just like anyone else. I am 14 years old teenage girl and most of the times me and my friends go alone at the park, nearby market or evening coaching in our school walking alone which is atleast 20 to 25 minutes ride by foot and nobody even dares or think about walking close to us or looking at us. We do not wear abayas or burkas but still nobody stares at females especially men or underage boys and everyday we get home safely.                                                                                                                                                                                                    I am glad to see her leaving safe from the country which is not even safe for their own people and local women, so what about tourists\\foreigners, especially for solo travelers(mostly women), in my opinion she shouldn't left her hotel room alone without proper support or solo travel advisor.                                                                                                                                                                                                I am proud to say that my country Pakistan is one of the most safest countries for foreigners or solo traveler (especially for females),unlike India. I am also glad to hear such things from alot of female solo travelers that pakistan is much safer than India, I have also heard such things from even male tourists, i have also seen a video of a foreigner who ran away from india and came to pakistan and he couldn't control his happiness after leaving india. He also said when he left india that Pakistan gave me a big sigh of relief in his live.

Notice there is no other race other than indians... Hmm that is a first clue, it is not a place for tourists attractions.

Beware!  Most of these countries are very dangerous at these times. You might be safer travelling in your own country nowadays. Travelling internationally became such a hassle at airports, because of high security and bad service. Avoid at all costs. I've travelled the world. Been there, done that. You've been warned.

      "I don’t understand why do tourists intentionally travel in slum areas in India and then complaint about being harassed or scammed. People who live in slum areas are mostly uneducated, poor and desperate for money people. What do you expect from them. Stop doing that people. Instead go to more safe places like 5 star hotels and reputed restaurants with more classy people. Slums are slums regardless of which country you are travelling to. I am not against poor people but if your travelling to place where people don’t have money or basic necessities they can sometimes behave in weird ways. Don’t believe me try living in cities like Philadelphia in usa or Vancouver in canada with so much crime and drugs problems. If you are a foreigner my advice to you guys is to stay 5 star hotels and ask hotels to provide you cabs and tourist guides. So you can travel safely. No country is super safe nowadays. The only way you can keep yourself safe is by making right decisions well in advance. I have seen these kind of behaviours in many videos from some of the most developed countries. But they are also about the poor slum areas of any cities or areas with more drug problems. If you will only go to country to show slums, snakes and scammers in a country thats what you will face. Go to more safe cities and book safer accommodations from reputed Indian tourism websites before hand.",

India is one of the most invaded countries in history—Persians, Greeks, Arabs, Turks, Afghans, Mughals, British, and more. Centuries of foreign rule forced people into survival mode, where empathy and morals faded.\n\nEven after independence, corrupt leaders kept scamming their own people instead of rebuilding. On top of that, the country has extreme cultural and religious diversity—so many different communities, beliefs, and values without real unity. That creates constant friction and disconnect.\n\nThis country didn’t become like this by choice—but because of what it went through. And as an Indian, I believe it will take time to become morally strong, clean, and ethical again.",

As i was on my way, i found drunk men on a bench near the hotel. They noticed me and asked \"Where are you from? \" I hesitated and i replied \"Russia\" They started laughing loudly and told something like \"6000 ki russian\" I felt uncomfortable and went in. As soon as i entered, i saw a rat. I went to a better hotel then. The next day, I was scammed by some little girls telling me to come to their home. I thought they are innocent and they led me to a park. They stopped me and started asking for money. Gave them 100 but started asking for 500 and there was no way to escape. So i gave them 500. As i went to a tourist attraction but found a man staring at me. I ran, but he kept following. I thought i got rid of him but he came out of nowhere and holded my hand. I felt really uncomfortable. He took me to a bench and sat next to me. He tried to touch me illegally (like my legs because i was wearing a short skirt) i tried to run away and felt really bad.

I was living in Japan at the time, which I thought was a culture shock but India was a culture shock on steroids.  I grew up in London in a diverse area near the predominantly Indian neighborhoods, best Indian food is in London.  I was a journalist so I didn’t have “as much” torment as the woman in this video (having a real press pass helped tremendously to get the harassers to back off).  Overall, I vowed I would never go back \n\nBut then I did…. six months later I went to Mumbai and Goa, and it was night and day.  I stayed with a documentary filmmaker and his family in Mumbai for a month, and rented a motorcycle to ride around Goa.  I loved it the second time.  Hated it the first time.  Also back then all I had was a paper travel book.  No apps.  No internet.  The second time I traveled on my British passport, which made a big difference also than the first time when I traveled on my American passport.  \n\nI’ve given a lot of places a second chance.",

      "Oh, please — let’s be clear here. How can you generalize an entire country based on one individual’s negative experience in a particular region? Criticizing India as a whole based on limited exposure is not just unfair — it's factually misleading.\n\nYes, India faces developmental challenges, like many nations, but calling it underdeveloped ignores its rapid economic growth, technological advancements, and cultural richness. And comparing it to China, while brushing over China's own deeply rooted issues like censorship, human rights concerns, and significant poverty in rural regions, is equally unbalanced.\n\nEvery country has its strengths and flaws. The real issue here is lack of research. If someone genuinely wanted to explore Indian culture, there are countless destinations — historically rich cities, serene spiritual retreats, world-class heritage sites, and modern urban centers — far beyond the \"outskirts\" that were described.\n\nAs someone who has lived in India, I can confidently say many destinations here are underrated gems, places that feel like heaven and offer unforgettable experiences.\n\nIf China is portrayed as a \"godly\" superpower, then why do major social issues, income gaps, and unaddressed rural poverty still exist there? A superpower should set an example — not just economically, but also socially . \nI am not like you dragging the whole country in middle but just a remainder for you to take account of not the only flaws that were portrayed \n\n\nIn short: sweeping generalizations serve no one. Travel experiences should be based on open-minded exploration and proper research — not on assumptions and selective storytelling.",

Most of us are super friendly to foreigners but so mean to our own people and judge each other so easily, especially based on how someone looks or dresses. Mostly the worst thing foreigners might experience is getting charged more if they run into someone greedy. But for locals?

She chooses local hotels , street food , filthy buses. No middle class Indian uses these facilities. These facilities for lower income ppl. So if u think India is cheap and you can survive on nuts than be ready for such scammers as well. Even if I go to newyork and stays and roam in unsafe areas , I will also take such memories.

      "Oh, please — let’s be clear here. How can you generalize an entire country based on one individual’s negative experience in a particular region? Criticizing India as a whole based on limited exposure is not just unfair — it's factually misleading.\n\nYes, India faces developmental challenges, like many nations, but calling it underdeveloped ignores its rapid economic growth, technological advancements, and cultural richness. And comparing it to China, while brushing over China's own deeply rooted issues like censorship, human rights concerns, and significant poverty in rural regions, is equally unbalanced.\n\nEvery country has its strengths and flaws. The real issue here is lack of research. If someone genuinely wanted to explore Indian culture, there are countless destinations — historically rich cities, serene spiritual retreats, world-class heritage sites, and modern urban centers — far beyond the \"outskirts\" that were described.\n\nAs someone who has lived in India, I can confidently say many destinations here are underrated gems, places that feel like heaven and offer unforgettable experiences.\n\nIf China is portrayed as a \"godly\" superpower, then why do major social issues, income gaps, and unaddressed rural poverty still exist there? A superpower should set an example — not just economically, but also socially . \nI am not like you dragging the whole country in middle but just a remainder for you to take account of not the only flaws that were portrayed \n\n\nIn short: sweeping generalizations serve no one. Travel experiences should be based on open-minded exploration and proper research — not on assumptions and selective storytelling.",

      "As an indian woman who grew up in DELHI... i also tell my foreigner friends not to travel alone... even i have never gone into the areas this girl has gone... however even tho i havent faced harassment myself... many of my family members have... IM REALLY ashamed and dissapointed at the men in my country. We need to purify their ideals. Never in a million years would i recommend any woman from going alone into the areas she went in her.... she has guts for trying this out I deeply apologise on the whole countries behalf and unfortunately heartbroken i cannot do more to help this poor girl\n\n\nHOWEVER after reading all these comments from NRI's and also indians, im deeply dissapointed in them. India is a beautiful country just polluted by evil thoughts. One should definitely visit India, not alone, and also asking educated local Indians where, when and how to go. If you cannot find anyone, or don't know anyone, walk into big/ respected 5 star resturaunts or hotels and ask the staff. \n\nAlas i cannot improve mens thoughts BUT let us not forget that this does not happen only in India. My friend went to NY and experienced harassment near Statue of Liberty and catcalling, and keeping in mind she was with her WHOLE extended family. The same friends was stalked till her hotel room in Switzerland. My family were scammed in Thailand, by a taxi driver and street vendors, and in London , by people calling us names for our indian ancestry. A classmate of mine was hit with a motorbike in front on disneyworld, and when i say no one came to her aid, no one did. It was only when an elderly woman saw her bleeding head did anyone come help.  \n\nSo IT IS NOT JUST INDIA. We have to remember, such societal problems are everywhere. harassment, catcalling, s3xualising women is something that is everywhere. AND NO i am not saying this just because im from india, I openly admit that it is not safe for anyone to come here alone. Let us all not just sit on our behinds and type on videos and actually take action everywhere. we need safer streets everyone. The whole world needs to come together to bring change. The world needs us. \n\nany indians reading this, i do not want you all to just sit and nod at the screen, you see anyone harassing a women, confront them. DO ANYTHING. DO NOT STAND AND RECORD. AND GIRLS IF ANYONE IS HURTING/STALKING YOU, TAKE THE STAND. Turn around and slap the wits out of that man cause trust me, that moment of power will save you from a lifetime of trauma. \n\nThats where I'll conclude this. I'll NOT be replying to any comments, i was just putting my views forward with my right to speech and as can you all. but i will not be continuing this conversation any forward and not to be caught in any form of drama.",

      "Dear Travellers,\n\nAs a South Indian, I genuinely feel sorry for what this traveler had to go through. Sadly, many parts of North India — especially crowded cities like Delhi — can be overwhelming, even for Indians ourselves. But to any foreign tourist watching this: India is vast and diverse. Please don’t judge the entire country based on one region. If you're planning to explore India, I strongly recommend starting with South India.\n\nSouth India offers a beautiful blend of safety, hospitality, culture, and natural beauty. Whether it's the backwaters of Kerala, the clean and tech-savvy city of Bengaluru, the heritage of Tamil Nadu, or the beaches of Goa — you'll find peace, kindness, and a slower pace of life.\n\nWomen, including solo female travelers, often report feeling safer and more respected in the South. Public transport is more orderly, people are warm, and the food is just incredible.\nThis shouldn't have happened to her — especially in the capital city. We must do better as a country to protect our guests. \n\nUntil then, I urge travellers: choose South India for a safer, soulful, and unforgettable experience. 🇮🇳❤",

Before you go ANYWHERE be it India, South Korea, Afghanistan or the USA, you check out the cultural norms of the country, you check out all the bad things, and what to be careful of, and you learn at least some if the language spoken there enough to get by. I have never been to India, but i at least know that you dont eat street food, and dont wear shorts out on the street. I also know their obsession with very pale skin! And their mysogyny and disregard for women. Even many indian women have negative views towards other women! This is why i appreciate india from afar, and i have no passion to travel there. Its also why when i traveled to Brazil, i had problems and had a great time!:you couldn't pay me to travel to India, any islamic nation. I wouldnt travel to russia or most of europe either! Im already in a racist country so why would i travel to another country for more racism? You have to be BRUTALLY honest and ready for the bullshit.

Also see their behavior as tourists in other countries at \"Videos Of Indian Tourists Misbehaving Abroad Go Viral, Desi People Say 'Stop Embarrassing Us!'\" Same with many rape cases in IN which many said the victim dress too provocative -- again as if it's the victims faults. This reflects their mindset and no wonder why some said in IN even the cow are more respected than women. Friendly or not is not the reason to sexually harass anybody. Whatever others dress is their right and it also not the reason for them to be assaulted. Funny that In always brag that their land is the biggest democracy yet the basic on right which is fundamental of democracy seems to be no exist in their mind. Anyway what they do to others -- comments, actions, etc. all shows their mindset. Think for yourself how disgusting they are. Oh and last there will be many defend them that there are just some IN. It's true that 100% or 0% exists only in math. BUT how high the chance of you to meet those sexist is another story. Why in some places there are almost none, YET why there are tons of cases in IN? You cannot fix anything if you keep deny that those problems are not real. YET that's the way IN always do. They are too coward to admit they can do wrong like all.

My father is a good 220lb guy who was a correctional officer.  So he has dealt with hardened criminals and mobs bosses all his life.  On his one trip he was about to come back and booked a taxi from his village to the Amritsar airport.  The taxi driver, instead of taking him to the airport, stopped at the outskirts of the city limits and demanded his money.  My father refused, and after some argument my father gave him some money.  Along came a husky bhappa sikh who kept offering my father for help, to come to his place to rest and stay the night.  My father felt the whole situation was off, said no, and got on a rickshaw to go to his niece who had a home in Amritsar.  It was more than an hour away on rickshaw.  But during that whole time the husky sikh followed him from a distance.   They could not find the house, since India has no street signs.  My father then told the rickshaw guy to take him to a nearest police station.  That is how he escaped that scary situation.  India is dangerous not just for women but also for foreign men.  After sun down, India is whole different ball game.  Avoid India at all cost if you can.",

It was one of the best times of my life. Its ancient land holds something sacred I cannot explain.   TIPS : All that beg aren't always desperate, ill, or homeless -  Don't give to the children they  attack out desperation - Don't go out at night on your own -  Each state has a different religion /dress code - Act like a chameleon..Trust your intuition. Don't answer your door at night.  Some men will come in unannounced -  BE SMART.  I TRAVELLED  NEW DEHLI, DEHLI, AGRA, VARRANASSI, MUMBAI, GOA, HAMPI, RAJASTHAN,  MCLEOD GANJ, DHARMASALA.  ❤ DO NOT FEAR INDIA. CALL FOR AMMA WHEN YOU LAND. TO KEEP YOU SAFE. TRUST IN YOUR GUIDES.

Thus, I'm used to the gentle hospitality as I travel with my family and have fun exploring in South India. Seeing this video made me realize just how toxic most people can be on the mainland and why you should never really travel alone without trusted friends and family who know about the place you're going to, thus ensuring a smooth and memorable journey.  stay safe and precausious, its always best to understand the language of ppl to where your heading to and always plan well and coordinate with trusted good known ppl. each place in india is different so ppl can either be found united and supportive or the opposite. please research more if you dont know the place your going to really well!!!",

AND GIRLS HEAR ME OU WHENEVER YOU FEEL LOW AND BAD WITH YOUR LIFE ALWAYS REMENBER THAT THERE IS A TEEN GIRL IN INDIA WHO IS FACING STALKING , HARRASMENT ETC . at least your life is better than her.

Why is it that Indians in Korea are not allowed to visit Korean restaurants? I heard there is so much racism against and hatred for Indians in your country. Is it why you come her to justify your hatred by proving that we are bad? We are a country with a large population and a large proportion of it is still poor (still recovering from the loot and plunder of 200 years of British rule).

Люди там не имеют внутренних качеств, присущих другим народам, так скажем иной наружности. \nПохотливы, неряхи, изгаживают собственные улицы, страну, но в доме стараются соблюдать чистоту, полное отсутствие благодарности за добро: поможешь - будут пытаться вытянуть денег еще и еще.\nЗа месяц путешествий, встретил только двух достойных индийцев, что поступили по-человечески. Один из них подвез меня и как бы я ни пытался дать ему денег, он отказывался, говоря, что просто помог иностранцу, при чем он был небогат. Для того, кто живет в таком окружении с такими ценностями, это ну очень достойно.\nВ общем, если вы не занимались единоборствами и не готовы оторвать голову нехорошим людям - ехать туда крайне не рекомендуется. А если и поедете и в плане безопасности у вас все будет более менее нормально, не уверен что в других аспектах хороших впечатлений останется больше чем плохих.",

      "Bro I hope you checked on the comments on your video. And lets come to conclusion. The reasons you pointed out are 40% cause of the racism.\n\n1. When the people died in plane crash. Unhone kya galat kiya why they are facing racism by foreigners that \"the plane must be stinky\", \"all the brit passport holders name would be patel\". \"Few people from the gross race left out\". Is it valid?\n2. What Gukesh had to do with this why is he facing racism over loose of that white man(I don't even know his name). Is it valid?\n3. Many foreign vloggers visit only poor parts of India and show only that image. And many visit again and again yet complain and cry. If you hate India so much why are you going back there again. Is it valid?\n4. Countries like Korea, Japan and China hate people solely based on their skin colour or race. They consider Indians as third class citizens without knowing nothing about India? Is it valid?\n5. Violence against South Asians in western countries especially USA and Canada are never taken seriously in court. The culprit either only have to pay a small fine or a small detention. Even in the cases of gun shot violence against Indians. If you beat up a South Asian and if you are white, you are free to go we deserve that. Bow down to that law and order. Is it valid?\n6. The foreign media always brings negative portrayal of India, their human rights agendas despise India if we India protect its citizens from terrorists, but they goes numb when Israel killed 1/3 of the Gaza youth. When recently US bombed civilized ateas of Iran, when Netherlands banned mosque and Quran. Is it valid?\n\n7. Was it valid when 100 Indian students were deported to India handcuffed but the UN make us apologise when a US diplomat was caught red handed on Delhi airport and was to be detentioned. Would accept its 100 citizen to be even deported from a country for criminal offences. \n8. Is it valid to consider every Indian man a rapist, when single US have more unreported rape cases than India. Or is it valid to say Indian woman ugly when half of the western women( especially youth) are on \"only fans\", where 2/3 of the kids' parents are either divorced or have a step parent. \n\nThere are many more points to be addressed but the above 8s are enough. I agree India has lot to improve taking from civic sense to infrastructure but that doesn't mean one can generalize a 1.45 billion of Indians. We have to change but not by believing \" World think of us Indians like shit, must we Indians are all at fault, we deserve this hate\". No man why chasing the validation of those WESTERNERS whose entire economy is based on the genocide of another race. The people who never knew what a hustle is or aren't bold enough to do a low paying job to earn for their family. Why you need the validation of those NORTH EAST ASIAN countries who judges someone's personality or one must be employed solely based on his/her looks or race. Those hypocrites who racially abuse South asians or other darker skin ethnicity than them but cry about when they face the same in the west.\n\nLastly BE SELF AWARE BUT NOT SELF LOATHING FOOL WHO THINKS BEING INDIAN IS A SHAME",

Like every country, India has both good and bad people. But India is a democratic country, unlike many other Asian nations.\n\nYes, if you dig deep, you’ll find crimes and cases of mistreatment, especially against women but let’s be clear: in India, we also worship women. We have more goddesses than gods, and the cultural respect for women is deeply rooted.\n\nSo don’t believe everything this video tries to portray. Most of it is manipulative and based on fake narratives. Instead, visit her channel and watch more videos before judging. You’ll find a mix of experiences, good and bad, which is common in every country.\n\nIf you’re a tourist, stick to well-known places. If you always seek the cheapest options, you must understand that not everyone is rich, and some people will always try to make money in easier or less honest ways, again, this happens everywhere.\n\nThis channel doesn’t provide any real insight or authentic information. If you truly want to understand India, follow reliable travel vloggers, tourism channels, or current affairs platforms.\n\nThis channel simply isn’t worth your time.",

      "I have been to India about 4 times and never had any problems even though I'm Hindu Bengali I appear to look foreign but even so I had no problems. I mingled in with the locals and the only time I got asked for money is at Haridwar and that's it also I had no issues with that because the lady was so friendly when she approached me. Lots of YouTubers go to India and they have no problems whatsoever. I think best thing is do your research and always blend in. Also, choose touristic areas where there will be other foreigners and you don't stand out. That creepy girl in black clothing following her was the worst part . I would visit prestigious places where there are educated citizens and they don't pay much attention to foreigners because they see them all the time. Mumbai is one of those places! Other places don't see much foreigners and they get excited when they do and MODI CUT DOWN THE POPULATION DUDE!!!!! I felt sorry for her but girl c'mon Goa beach shorts ... Okay ! India ... No way as they think it's underwear for girls so always wear covered clothes . She looks like from Nepal so idk why they were harassing her ?? Cos girls from Nepal are very fair and have similar features. It's cos of the progro camera which attracts attention. India isn't a bad place, it's where you go. Some places are underrated and some are like really high standard areas full of amazing, westernised and educated people of india like the guy she met on the bus but he got kicked off cos the driver didn't like his hospitality with the foreign girl obviously. China has scammers too ! I got scammed by a Chinese who wouldn't give me a refund also the girl at the end looks completely different like it's two people. Interesting!!!! China is just as bad as India",

      "Bruv, I went to India in 2017 with another friend (both guys) and the moment we stepped out of Delhi airport, the uber driver just didn't want to show up. Naturally, the scammers came. At that point I didn't read up or was as well versed against scams. So they promised us a fee that was much lower than the uber and agreed to take us to our hotel. What we failed to realize at that point was that another guy joined his driver friend with us in the frontseat. We didn't think much of it back then but it was his accomplice. Halfway during the ride, my friend kept noticing the driver going around in circles, citing \"road blocks due to festivals/holidays\", something felt off already. But I still was naive back then so I didn't really look at the route he was going in. \n\nAfter a while, he kept doing the same thing and said that he'd \"inform\" our hotel we were gonna be late and weirdly asked for my hotel reservation papers (which I stupidly gave) - and it was obviously a lie because he tried to cancel our hotel bookings. At this point we already knew it was a scam but we wanted to play along and see how it'd turn out. We got a bit frustrated and told him to stop us somewhere near our hotel. Lo and behold: he stopped us right outside a TRAVEL AGENCY. LOL! We were like wtf, but were ushered in anyway. Of course we said no, because the mf inside told us our hotel has cancelled our rooms due to \"some issue\" (driver was supposedly talking to the hotel staff during the car ride trying to cancel our rooms). The prices were also way more expensive, and we just firmly stormed out of there, paid the low cab fee and walked off. They looked pissed and bewildered but I was ready to let 15 years of Muay Thai go if I had to. I then googled the way and we walked all the way to our hotel for around 10mins, through some underbridge slums and insane traffic filled with thick smog.\n\nAs you would expect, the hotel had no issue checking us in! Afterwards everything in the trip went great. The service at the hotel was very good, butter curry was insanely delicious that we ate there 2-3 times. As for the rest of the trip, it was nothing short of amazing. Simply because - all the other trips I booked was through agoda/trip advisor, things like Delhi by Cycle (rode bicycles through old neighbourhoods, slums, new and old delhi, monuments etc - a very organized guided tour with great tour guides checking up on our safety, recc'ing us great restaurants to go to). Every place I booked (Taj Mahal, Red Fort etc) had a tour guide and a private van, warned us of the local scams etc. But obviously if you don't want to buy jewellery from their \"friend's\" shop, don't. They won't force you. Same shit happened when kids would walk up to us, I'd just give the fk face and walk away \"arrogantly\" so they know not to bother you. If anything, just stare. I understand this may be \"rude\" but you certainly do not want 20 kids chasing you for $ when you've given one. It opens the floodgates as you can see in this video.\n\n\nEver since then, I've read up on almost all the scams before travelling to said destination and watched tons of videos on the topic. Think Honest Guide/Karl Rock, Scambaiter/Jim Browning/Scammer Payback, and those Europe Metro theft ones. I also do not carry any LOUSY bags that AREN'T anti-theft while travelling. Why I say this is because I use PACSAFE and sling my shit to the front, wallet/cash is all locked up in the anti-theft zipper mechanisms, and phone has to be zipped up in my pocket OR zipped up and hooked in my slingbag. I suspect this will only matter if you travel to Spain/Barcelona/France or yea India lol, where there are many snatch thieves. I am constantly on guard and I'm observing my surroundings no matter where I go.",
