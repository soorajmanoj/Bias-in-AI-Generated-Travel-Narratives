      "Oh nooo as soon as I seen those bathers I was like oh godddd don’t do it",
      "your Osprey backpack, do you use that as carry-on or a checked bag?",
      "The smaller the pack, the more enjoyable your travel will be.\nIf you don't have to make the trip about yourself you don't need so much cloth. If you go in hot inexpensive countries, you can buy extra stuff there if you realize you need more or you are unexpectedly invite to see some king or prince...\nThe ideal for hot countries is to have 1 bag that can be taken in cabin with you:\nNo luggage registration (saved me from missing some planes because of delays due to accidents on the way to the airport), no stolen or lost luggage, no waiting at the arrival for your luggage.\nYou can easily walk with your pack and you can always buy an extra bag if you need to take back some stuff.\nRemember that people live in those countries, so you will probably find all you need there.",
      "everyone commenting about respecting culture like yes that is a part of it but yall forgetting about rampant catcalling & harrasment🤨🤨",

      "SOOOO off topic, but I've been watching your videos for a while and couldn't figure out who I thought you looked like, but you seriously look SO much like Marla Catherine!",
      "you are beautyful ^^",
      "Hi Elena I’m just curious when you’re backpacking and carrying all your camera gear, what’s it like doing this all in carry on baggage? I know in Australia we can’t carry more than 7kg in carry on and can’t take spare batteries etc in carry on that has to go in checked bags. So is that the same in other countries or are you allowed to take these items and weight in carry on? Thank you!",
      "love how your vlogs read like a storytelling, they’re so soothing",
      "Not telling anyone how to pack bc it’s whatever works for u. But something I’ve loved in my travels is separating my comfy clothes and underwear into one cube and my dressy clothes into another!!",

      "Where is the camera purse from??",

      "elena i have a very important question: your backpack. im about to go packpacking europe for 5 weeks, you got the 40L, which technically can fit in carryon specifications. just wondering if you checked your backpack in or carried it on. because i would love to not have to worry about my backpack going missing/damaged and carry it on, but in your experience, is it just easier to check it in?\nalso, if i do carry on my backpack, does that mean i cant have a carryon bag along with it? sorry if i sound dumb, im very new to this and theres so many answers to these questions. xxxx",
      "I have a question which is unrelated to this video. I've been watching your videos for a while now and I wanted to know how you make friends so fast? And how do you make great, lifetime friends not just people to party with. You seem to move around a lot and always find a bunch of friends wherever you go.",
      "I've been to india a couple times during the summer, and its always best to stick to a t-shirt and some lightweight/comfortable pants OR a long dress! I'm worried that you're going to be really uncomfortable in those long sleeve blouses",
      "Welcome to India 🇮🇳.. I’m from India. Girl, you can wear anything what makes you comfortable but whatever you have packed is perfect since weather is too hot here. Hope you will enjoy here.",

      "your hair is looking lucious as heck, elena!!! loved this vid",
      "i don’t understand why she has to “respect the culture” by being modest, i mean yeah of course you respect the culture, and the people, but if you don’t believe in being extremely modest, then you shouldn’t have to, she’s wearing all these long sleeves in 100 degree weather, that’s way, just not okay, she could literally faint from heat stroke, i don’t know i guess i’m just a little sensitive about the whole “modest” thing, it’s just a touchy subject for me, and how as girls we are stereotyped that we have to cover every inch of our body no matter what and that we can’t show our body off, because i think we all know that back in the day we were just objects used for cleaning & having children.. so idk ig i’m the only one it just bothers me when people tell you to “be modest” for a certain place or culture if that’s not something that yk, necessary strictly follow.",
      "I think a nose piercing would look so good on you!",
      "I’m going to India in two days can’t wait. As I’m in England I’m going from12 degrees to mid 30s. Whoop whoop",

      "excited for you to be  here, you will love it here but do mind India is kind of hot during April. Love from India..",
      "Hey Elena! Depending on where you are in the city, it's not necessary to dress that modestly. If you're not vising the older parts of the city ( I can only talk about Delhi because i live here) you'll be fine ditching the tank top underneath your blouses, or maybe wearing just the tank top. Try avoiding foods with any raw vegetables in it, as that will help avoid the upset stomach. You should also get a big scarf, which will come in useful if you plan on visiting temples. Make sure it's light and airy. \nHope you have a great time here!",
      "I am Indian. Who likes India hit the like button",
      "I am expecting a beautiful blog in India ♥️♥️.",
      "girl be careful in India...stay at good hotels...dont stay at low hotels...do not go alone in night....just be careful and more aware...gud luk",
      "Hey Elena! Indian girl here\nFew tips: use Uber or ola(Indian version of Uber) and don't use local cabs cause they might charge you extravagantly. Stay hydrated cause heat strokes are very common here. And buy only packaged water bottles like bisleri, aquafina, kinley. Ask for those in restaurants instead of drinking the water they serve you(even if they claim it's RO). Your immune system isn't adapted to the weather and water so try not to eat uncooked food like chaats. If you are in Delhi or any of the other northern states then please be cautious of your surroundings. Keep everything locked at all times. If you're having trouble navigating or feel uncomfortable, look for women(preferably younger ones who're usually fluent in English). If you feel uncomfortable at any point, then speak out, people will help you out.\nHope you have a wonderful time here! It really is quite safe nowadays but since you are well dressed and (hate to say it) white, people will think that you have a lot of money to spare and ask for ridiculous amounts of money. Otherwise I'm sure you're gonna love it here!",
      "How did your things from Valija Gitana fit? Is it pretty true to size/run small/run big? Also what sizes did you get? i think we'd be similar and I'm trying to decide before i order haha! thanks :)",
      "Western women will get attention no matter how they are dressed, but also if you dress too rich it attracts attention because you look like you don’t belong and don’t look like most backpackers. India is very hot and so it’s casual. I think you might suffer tucking in those blouses, you really need the very lightest fabrics, air flowing. The sleeves on that orange blouse will be too hot. Skip the jewelry and fancy looking purse. And why socks? All you want is sandals. I traveled 8 months in Asia I don’t like packing cubes it’s just more wrinkles and makes packing more of a chore I just lay clothes flat as possible in the pack. Cubes for underthings and toiletries only. My advice skip the blouses and bring more basic t shirts. The khaki wide leg pants look like too thick of fabric. Have fun, India is full of lovely interesting people and it’s also a big culture shift.",
      "don't all your liquids have to be in one limited bag for international travel?",
      "Omg I loved this",

      "i love your clothes!!!",
      "where did you get your toiletry bag from? the greenish one",
      "I love that you're trying to be respectful but wearing shorts and short sleeved tops are totally fine as long as they're not booty shorts haha! Maybe keep one or two long pants and tops for temples if you go to any but that's all you need! Enjoy your trip!",
      "tbh i wouldnt wear bikinis in india unless u want to sexually assulted, like seriously stay safe i hate to say this but its dangerous country fro women.",
      "Elena you should definitely visit the north east, it's beautiful out here!",
      "As a puerto rican, I'm so proud Valija Gitana sponsored you. Valija Gitana is a puerto rican brand that has grown a lot over the past years. I'm so happy puerto rican businesses are growing outside the island, where they don't have much chance to grow because of international businesses overshadowing them  like Forever 21, H&M, Walmart, Walgreens and LOTS more. Since Puerto Rico is a US colony, I'm so happy to see that our own local brands and companies are being recognized outside the island :))",
      "Are you going to visit the Indian state of Kerala (land of coconuts) too ? Since you are a nature loving person you must not miss this place ❣ It's hot here at the moment, but you might enjoy the greenery  ,the beaches and the hillstations. Have a lovely and safe trip 🌻",

      "India is WONDERFUL. I've spent 42 days in Mumbai. I went during winter and it was hell warm hahaha I loved your clothing choices, they really suit India. Onde thing I used a lot there were close and dark shoes, because the streets were very dirty. Try not to used shirts that shows your sholders, cause people will look at you and it will be unconfortable. Take a lot of repellent, like A LOT, I used at least 4 tubes on my 6 weeks there; also hair ties, because its gonna be WARM hahah And some kind of stomach pills for stomach burning, because of the food. And NEVER NEVER accept tap water or juice of any kind. Just stick to the sealed liquids only!!!!\nAnd have and amazing time in India <3",

      "Hey frm India! 👋🏻",
      "Come to Patiala Punjab India!!!",
      "Okay so you don’t need to cover yourself up for anyone. You should wear whatever you want to. India’s a secular country, meaning, there are more than one culture and 28 official languages. So technically there’s particular one culture in India and this means it doesn’t mean you should cover yourself up to respect any culture. I am a Hindu and yes we have certain types of restrictions but then they aren’t officially stated and it’s just made by the society so at the end of the day you can wear anything and still respect the culture here.",
      "I respect that you want to dress modestly. It's great to show respect to other cultures",
      "I born and raised in India and I live in Kolkata and trust me I wear shorts and tank tops and all the other kinds of short dresses and it is pretty safe here. Just don't roam around during midnight alone otherwise you are safe as home anytime anywhere in my country.",

      "Are you going to travel solo in India?",
      "Girl I know you are already in India but  please don’t do skincare (use masks) on the airplane cuz can make you breakout because of the tons of bacteria’s. You should do your skincare before you get into the plane, is gross to see the amount of bacteria’s that can be in there",

      "Suuch a helpful video! Def makes me rethink how I’m going to pack for my weeklong trip to Toronto. Do you have any tips for how to pack for different weather requirements (aka could be 70 or 35 degrees)? Are the packing cubes as useful and recommended for plus size folks with larger clothes? Thanks in advance and I hope you have a blast in India!",

      "Have a wonderful, safe trip.  Julie Buttons from Phoenix",
      "You repeatedly saying that you are carrying 'modest' and 'conservative' clothing sounds really stereotypic which isn't really true, girls do wear shorter clothes there without thinking twice and get by only if it isn't a religious place, so yeah try not to stereotype India while you are there it may sound a bit offending.\nDon't get me wrong I love all your clothes but it just kept bugging me. Hope you have a good time there.",

      "You travel so much... I LOVE IT xx 😘",
      "Girl depending on the city you can more or less wear anything in India. I hate to see you wearing full sleeves in the kind of heat we’re experiencing!

I have the 55L version with the detachable pack (so the main pack is 40 and the daypack is 15),when I got mine the 40L version didn't have the detachable daypack option. I'm happy with mine (especially since I'm tall) but every once and a while I think about downsizing and didn't realize a smaller option with the daypack was available.",

Not even in Australia where I'm from because we have had a lot of people, and not just women, young men too,  go missing whilst hitchhiking or driving alone in their car at night in the outback.",

      "Perhaps one might think that having children is a good path, and indeed, they may be good paths, but Christ Jesus shows us a much more excellent path (He aquii yo les muestro un camino mucho más excelente dice su palabra). Often, pleasure, or excessive pleasure, is detrimental to our health and does not help us mature as humans.\nThe love that Jesus and God have for us will never compare with the love we receive from another person, no matter how good that person is, whether it be the Pope or the best man in the world (he held the Guinness record according to his life history), and Jesus, God and the Holy Spirit act in a personal or invisible way, that is, in a chemical way, so to speak, healing our organs, brain, anointing us with love, taking away our pain, just as Jesus healed people of ailments, as in ancient times.\nThat's why we should always act peacefully and be as original as possible. It's good to discover our true personality, which resembles our parents a bit and is shaped by what we read, the experiences of our teachers, the education we've had, the friends we've chosen, etc.",

      "I hitch hiked in the northern part of India back in October. It was such a cool experience. It was so freeing and opened my eyes to what traveling can really be like. \n\nLong story short, I met a few guys in a hostel my first day in Delhi, and ended up spending a few weeks traveling with them. We went to Leh, Ladakh (northern India) and hitched a ride from there to Diskit. There were pretty insane roads up there: picture unpaved, rocky, and exposed cliffs. Went over a very high mountain pass at nearly 18000 feet (5480m). We had to split off into two hitched rides because it was hard as a group of 3 to get a lift. Our driver in the car I rode in was so kind and refused money from us. We even stopped for some hand-made noodles in the most delicious thukpa soup on the way and tried butter tea. They had a sweet dog in the car and I had to sit in the middle seat so the dog could have the window seat 😂\n\nTried to hitch a ride a few days later up to Turtuk, but after spending 4 hours trying to hitch a ride and getting caught in a sand storm, we ended up having to get a taxi. The taxi driver was over an hour late lol. It was a crazy day. \n\nHitch hiking is awesome. Be careful especially if you’re a woman! I felt safe because I was traveling with two men, but otherwise *personally* I wouldn’t have hitch hiked. But that’s just me :)",

      "I stopped watching YouTube in 2016, you were one of the last YouTuber that I followed. I’ve been living a blur since then. Now that I have found myself with time and have slammed myself out of the adolescent cloud that mists up perception, I asked myself, what’s next? So in complete confusion I tried to conjure up the most normal thing a “normal person” would do.. and then it hit me, Watch YouTube. As you can imagine most of the Youtubers that I watched back then were just about Gone or gone rogue buttt, but for month of watching conspiracies and things like that I felt this weird feeling of the YouTube world.. even that has changed.. so here I am months in and here I come across your page and it’s exactly the type of messages I need right now in my life. It’s so ironically funny how I find you doing the most relevant and intriguing thing, just as When I was a teen, but now it’s the same effect as an adult. Just where I left off hahaha I’m on a path of self discovery, and these moments are keys from the universe that  re-direct me back to the beginning. I guess you can’t hit fast forward and expect to remember the movie plot ahhh. Basically finding your video was part of a mini epiphany I am having as I write this and for anyone that needs to understand why you don’t understand where you are now, you have to retrace your steps and reconnect with who you are. who might I be you may ask.. ask yourself this: who were you as a young person, what did your 15 year old self want to be? Anyway, Luke Korns, I just wanted to say that your work and what you’re doing, your involvement has really grown and it’s RADDDD that your growth of change has coincided with your audience. You’re still an example and a pillar which is the coo part, your growth is reflective on an exponential growth of your audience, if we take a step you recollect by taking 3 it’s a weird thing I’m not good at math but like it’s rad and I sees it and i applause for it hahaha Our internal child isn’t dead, and you give life to my internal child. Thank you for your work thank you for continuing to be that genuine person that I always used to watch and would distract me from the horrors of life, I never meet others like me so it’s awesome to watch the same mentality in action even though I rarely see it in physical form.

Her parents were right in the sense, its her life, live it in her own way. But the child marriage thing is straight up illegal and her parents should go to prison for that.

You can read a 100 books about the place and watch a 1000 videos but when you hitchhike, you hear the heartbeat of the place stripped of commerce and vanity. It's been a long time since a YouTube video moved me this much. I love the effort you've put into it, Amu for her story and strength of character, and thanks for showing me that there are kind people even in a low trust country like India.",

Bottom line is that Indians would likely have their visa cancelled and be deported from Western countries if they tried this, there - they need proof of sufficient funds and detailed itineraries just to get visas in the first place.

      "such a beautiful video luke, really understood why she took the decision to hitchhike. I live in India as well and what she said was completely true. Child marriage was a thing but not anymore which is great. But arranged marriages and forcing to marry someone else is very common here and as a guy, it's not tough because guys choose to marry who they want and parents can accept it as well. but if it's a girl child it's more harder to marry who they want to. Good thing is that it's not as hard as it used to be before so parents are more wide minded now but still that barrier exist which I'm not complaining about. There are issues to marrying someone off your religion and it's a real issue so I understand what and where the real barrier is. Ultimately, know what choices can make you happy and decide what you want to do with the choices you have. Have a good day!!",

She’s doing exactly what every women going through hard marriages should do. Also I appreciate your patience and will to execute this traveling despite the hurdles you both came across and specifically you as you’d have to adjust to the new environment of India, in terms of less comfort and more struggle in completing the journey, im sure she helped you do it.

      "I disagree that hitchhiking is all about luck. I've hitched all over the world for decades, and there are lots of things you can do when hitching to increase or decrease your chances of getting lifts. Main thing is don't hitch on fast roads, but find spots where cars are going slow enough to see you and react in time, and make sure there's a very easy and safe place cars can pull over for you. Look presentable enough, dont obscure your face with sunglasses etc, wear bright clothes if possible, make sure your backpack is visible so people know you're a backpacker. Don't just get in any car that stops, but ask where they're going and see if the place they're going will be a help or a hindrance to getting the next ride. Carry a physical detailed road map of the country/area you're in, as the map will have key information that Google Maps doesn't, such as petrol station locations. When doing the hitching itself, make sure your hitching arm and thumb are clearly outstretched, and not just resting down. A whiteboard, whiteboard markers, and rag can be very useful, even just as a prop. The more props you can display that indicate you're hitchhiking the better. Oustretched thumb, prominently visible backpack, readable sign with one or two words maximum. The sign isn't really necessary in a lot of situations but it can be a lifesaver sometimes. Some people say hitching should only be done during the day, but I've found that in some places, getting to a truck stop petrol station in the evening when trucks are doing longhaul trips can be useful if you just want to get where you're going and don't care about the scenery. Truckers will 99.99% never stop for you when they're moving, but the chances of one saying yes when you talk to them when they're parked or refuelling is very high. I could go on, but that's the basics I can think of",

They have fine architecture and if you have the habit  of doing meditation,  you can feel the energy  in Temples.  Especially  in kanchi kaamakshi temple there  is cosmic energy and you you can receive and feel while meditating in that temple. In Srirangam temple you can see Sri RAMANUJACHARYA  Mummified body . It is 1000 years old and internal parts were not  disturbed  in the Mummification and only red sandalwood paste and camphor are applied to preserve the divine  body . He is a great saint and incarnation of Adi sesha  (a divine serpant which is close to Lord Vishnu)",

      "@1:07 - I do have tips on hitchhiking in India ( ateast in Tamil Nadu ). Ask for a lift (hitchhiking is called lift in many places ) from a place with less traffic and preferably no public transport. The rarer the vehicles the better your chances. \n\nThe drivers are sympathetic when there is no one around as they believe it is their responsibility to help. If there is lot of traffic every driver will believe someone else will help and at the end no one helps.\n\nThis is commonly known as \"Bystander effect\" but applies here as well",

This creating youtube video and potentiality earning higher, but is choosing to not pay even a penny to hardworking people. While I appreciate the good will of local people, I don't think this kind of travel is ethical. Once, more and more people start doing this, the local people will not be that helpful and trusting, which may potentially shift their attitude towards travellers and also travel experience of outsider, this is already happening in countries like Thailand.",

However, this video is about the people you meet on your journey, the comfort you feel in presence of strangers, and how travelling opens your heart to new cultures. This videos is about the adversities of life and how people cope with them and still believe in the world. Such a beautiful way of sharing your journey.",

'Game' is also British slang for someone who is up for FUN! I am an American and when I worked/lived in the UK British people called me a 'game bird' . Laughter!\n\n Game bird? What?  A 'game bird' is a young, beautiful woman who is adventurous, outgoing, fun, free. You are a game bird! I visited the north of India, Rajasthan.  For me it was a dream come true.  The people, architecture, food, history, spirituality, tradition.... everything amazed me. Most importantly is, YOU are a beautiful woman. Thank you for sharing your experience. Bless.",

      "I spent a lot of time hitch hiking through Tamil Nadu. It was quite difficult, because everytime the driver saw a white face, they wanted us to pay. But once we found a driver who took us for free, it was always worth the wait. Most of them even offered us some money and food. Indian people just are the kindest.",

Not for the reasons you might think. I am not shy, I have no problem with contacting a random stranger and getting to know them, and I am also not picky. I can and have slept in the street with no complaints. The problem is: I'm terrified for my safety. I know there are many amazing people out there, but all it takes is one to end my life. I just have to decide if it's worth the risk. Being a woman and a survivor of assault, I am scared to just pick up and go to a random country, though I dream of it every day. So, what I'm saying is, thank you for living my dream life for me, so I can see what it would be like through your videos.",

I’m at a crossroad in my life, where I have to figure out what I’m going to do after school ends, but I honestly don’t know. Watching Luke hitchhike through India really makes me question who I am and what I’m doing. I’ve been told to study hard, make and save money, and go to a 9-5 job day in and day out. I think that this is what I want to do, but is it? Recently, I’ve been wondering whether my alter ego would be more like Luke, someone who’s incredibly open minded, who seeks experiences instead of materialistic goods, and someone who is willing to be unashamedly spontaneous. One day, I hope I’ll have enough courage to drop everything and travel the world, living through new experiences and making meaningful connections with seemingly random people. This isn’t just a YouTube video, this is a calling card to experience the world.",
      "luke you’re literally one of the most talented creators that i’ve ever seen on this platform. i love each and every one of your videos because they each teach something new, but all of your videos still have a common theme: everyone has their own unique and complex story. i love how you perfectly capture the story of anyone that’s willing to share it and tell the world what it needs to hear. you have sooo much purpose in this world, we need more people like you!!! thank you for an incredible video once again <3",

      "Wow. Really nice for you both! Did you have any sketchy rides? I always was careful with what I ate in Asia. Did you have any problems? Have you thought of going to Sri Lanka?",
      "great video!",
      "This video was amazing!",
      "wow. incredible",
      "Wow Luke, your videos are pure art, beautifully made, so well, that I always feel the need to watch them again! That girl reminds me of myself and I really needed to hear her words as I need a little push so I can free myself as well from a life that others have envisioned for me but it doesn't belong to me! Thank you for this wonderful video! Keep them coming!",
      "Damn Luke. I don't even have words to define your content and why i love it so much but i will try. It's a breath of fresh air, it's powerful, it's generous, you can feel deep empathy and love for humanity, and it's centered on someone else than just you. And I freaking love that. YouTube is full of \"me, me, me, look at me\" which is okay bit it's ALL THE TIME with most creators. You speak ideas and beauty through other people. You're the best at finding people as random and lovable as Amu. That need their ideals, opinions, and bold and beautiful stories to be shared to the world. People like her break stereotypes, give hope and assurance. Amu is a legend. I have so much respect for what she has done, it's going against the standards of a whole society. Because she's in touch with her consciousness, and her sense of what's right. Oh and also I love the way you build your voice overs with B-Roll. Waiting for the next video. Much love dude♥️",
      "ok this explains a lot of your bereals, incredible as always luke",
      "What a amazing girl ❤️",
      "It's a amazing story , but sad too \nI  actually liked this video dude",
      "You can't imagine how hard I've been waiting for a new video since discovering your channel. And I've not been disappointed. It is incredible how much impressions, feelings and meaning you can put into just 9 minutes of video. Watching feels like making experiences, growing and developing for like half a year.",
      "Beautiful. You are really capturing the soul of people in your videos.",
      "Parents are overrated sometimes.. we must make the world a better place, with or without them.",
      "Wow she is so inspiring!! I didn't know how much I missed Luke's videos until I saw this <3",
      "Oh, now I understand why the video took long to come. No complaints, you do it in your time, but that doesn't mean I don't miss you.\nI love how sometimes you just go for whatever opportunity that appears in your life, I wish I was like that, though sometimes it scares me a bit for real.\nCongratulations on another great video. Love you",
      "Amu is such an incredible soul! Amazing video",
      "So sad to hear that she was forced into an arranged marriage.",
      "What a beautiful soul. Devastating that she had her youth robed from her. I can't imagine forcing a 16 year old to marry someone 13 years older! Glad she's free and able to spread her wings now!",
      "❤❤❤",
      "love this!!!",

      "its amazing how you always find the people with the most incredible stories",
      "i love amu, she really is her own person",
      "I can't help but smile all through your videos. I feel like you have such a gift for finding positivity in this world. Thank you for telling Amu's story.\n\nMy tales of hitchhiking are quite different. Just Bolivian lorry drivers chatting a lot of Spanish to me whilst I nodded and felt confused. Less magical.",
      "Truly love her energy & message",
      "Some of the things I wanted to tell the world... thanks to luke I was able to get them to you.  When he came to India I had nothing else on my mind except that a YouTuber was visiting India.. but how quickly we bonded.. my first friendship outside of India.. what made it so beautiful was your good heart luke.. You have always taken care of me throughout the journey..I am so sooooo lucky to have a friend like you..\ntalking about video, you are the best storyteller I have ever seen❤I was sure your video would be great but this is the best than I expected.I learned from you that it is possible to tell such beautiful stories.Thank you for being my friend, traveling with me, loving and caring so much..I sincerely wish you to travel many more, tell many stories, reach many heights..\nMiss you sugar daddy😢\nI read the comments on this video and when I read it I was very happy again.  I have made some friends and relatives again.  Heartfelt thanks for your love❤❤❤",

      "great film luke",
      "It's so crazy to me that these videos aren't insanely popular",
      "I love a different lense of India 🇮🇳",
      "I love Amu's attitude and I feel exactly the same. Except I lived my life for others for 40 years. Glad to say that for the past 5 years I have also been a free bird. Not hitchhiking, but traveling full time and truly enjoying life on my terms! Thanks for this beautiful video. There are important messages to be shared!",
      "More than 50% of Indian men are pedophiles so be careful dude",
      "This is a beautiful video. People who live on the road have the most heartening and inspiring stories and views, but they often go unnoticed. Thank you for sharing such a story",
      "'across india' is quite a stretch, but good video nevertheless",
      "👏👏👏",
      "You know what Luke, you're making great stuff. I hope the algorithm pick it up more often. I'm glad to see you thriving again!",

      "it may be hard for you to upload very often, but it is definitely worth it, you make not only films, you tell stories.",
      "Another wonderful and meaningful video from you. Truly amazing, humble, and appreciative of a culture and lifestyle so different from yours. It's a joy to see, and can't wait to see more.",

      "Really love your vlog and how I never know what to expect.",
      "As an Indian fan of Luke since 2014, it’s such an honour to see him grow from just a simple YouTuber who made funny videos to the person he is today making such beautiful videos showing his ups and downs, without hiding any imperfections or bad experiences. I love how he visited India finally after promising to come here, back in 2014! Thank you for coming and I hope you can keep coming back, Luke! 💓 And I hope you gain lots and lots of different experiences here because India is so diverse, you’ll get to see something different and hear a different language even within a distance of a few kilometres! ❤️ Thank you for making such a gorgeous video!!",
      "Your content is amazing i just love these videos",
      "Honestly this video is gold, it reminds me of the quality of channels such as YesTheory. Well and truly well done and i don't know why your videos have been getting less views, hopefully the algorithm will be in your favor and more people will find your channel and those wouldn't have subscribed before will enjoy this new and eye opening content and give you a chance.",
      "Thanks for the nice video",
      "Amu has free spirit, which is even more amazing considering what she has been through. She really is a free bird💙",
      "Thinking about how I first saw one of your videos in spanish class. Now you've become my favorite person to watch.",
      "finally a vlog :D",
      "Luke!! I've been waiting to see what video you made in India! So excited to watch\n\nEDIT: Wow, this was not what I expected. Amu's story is special, yet so common in India. Child marriage & divorce are still such big taboos.. thanks for opening up. As a half-Indian female traveller, Amu inspired me a lot. I've been dreaming about hitchhiking and discovering my country for years but part of me is scared for my safety. She's right, you should \"learn from your experiences, not from what other people say\", and go see what the world is about with your own eyes, not just what you've read in newspapers or seen on TV. I'm really looking forward to going back to India now and create my own luck 🇮🇳 Thanks Luke, well done :)",
