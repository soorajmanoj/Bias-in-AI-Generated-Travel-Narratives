      "You should try the mobile payment option in India where you can pay almost everywhere where there is a QR code. It's safe, secure & cashless. For foreigners, you can research about the UPI One World payment option where possibly you get a digital wallet where you can load money & make payments anywhere where a merchant or person accepts payment via the QR code. You can see how the local Indians make payments using their mobile phone just by scanning the QR code at any shop or hotel. Maybe you should try so that you don't need to keep searching for an ATM machine or bank to withdraw cash. It's not that cash can be avoided completely but you can carry less cash. You always have an option to insist the merchant to take money via the QR code rather than physical cash saying you are not carrying much cash or don't have cash.",

But men are the ones who openly harrass white women, crossing their boundaries.",
      "Okay buddy. Imma be honest here. I hope you see this and reply. Indians are delusional. They don't know how their government is fooling them. You will see so many hatefull comments if you said something bad about india on yt because they are delusional and think india is greatest. They are so over proud. So, don't mind them. The things shown by western media are exaggerated but definitely there is true to some extent. Like dirtier streets, not following traffic rules, indian men being creepy(try to be alert around them. Saying this as an Indian man😭😭 and yes street food is unhygienic ( but there are so many indians who avoid stalls who don't maintain hygiene), there are many assulting and ra'e cases against women.People might show you the stats saying it's lot lesser but trust me there are so many cases unregistered becouse of the taboo unfortunately, you will get lot of stares for being white women, they will come upto you to take photos. I feel so sorry about the incident that happened to the Australian women recently. And the very important thing is never hesitate to share your bad experience. Ignore these delulu idiots in the comment section.I've seen lot of travel videos and posts on reddit. Women generally feel safer in south than north. Especially kerala. I've never been there tho.Delhi is a horrible place for women acc to them. Bengaluru, mumbai, kerala are a lot safer. And don't give people extra tip coz  they may charge more for foreigners next time. And here in india, the cheaper- the worse. Never settle for something cheap. You can book train tickets on the app. Don't travel in the general coach coz it's cheaper and there are lots of poor people who don't care about hygiene. They travel to diff states to work. Unfortunately, their main goal is to get the next meal and survive. I feel sad for them but yea try to book 1st class(expensive) or 2nd class tickets. If you've any doubt, ask indians on reddit. Coz on yt you will only find these delusional people who deny every issue of my country.",

      "Dude just avoid Delhi and its surroundings. Like a moth to the light, all the bad people are there. South India - Kerala and Tamil Nadu are backpack heavens and are safe and truly traditional. Manali ( mini Israel and weed culture & spiritual  ), Dharamshala ( Dalai Lama is here hiding) are lovely places to chill out nomadic for a while. State of Uttarakhand and Sikkim are perfect for month long stay and spiritual too. North East - Arunachal Pradesh and Meghalaya are pristine and calm. Perfect for relaxing but it's very cold now and you would definitely need to plan ahead. Transportation is bad and it's all mountains. Avoid Kolkata or West Bengal state. They are lost cause. No Odisha or middle of India or the east side🚫. Pondicherry is fine with the French culture.  Uttar Pradesh is where most of the spiritual stuff is from. State of 246 million people !!!! Varanasi ( cremation grounds ) Mathura (Krishna stuff).  The state of Bihar with 13 million people (Buddha was here 2000 years ago) is where you can see true poverty and population. Don't go there⛔. and it's election time🙅‍♂Not at all for backpacking! Gujarat and its people are very chill and it's an easy state to travel. Veg food is everywhere.  Punjab, only visit the big cities. Haryana is a lost cause 🚫.Bangalore is chill if you can afford the luxury and know a local. Did I mentioned to find a local friend from instagram or something. The tour guides are BS. Like a moth drawn towards the light, every extroverted, be it scammer or a random person is drawn towards white people. idk we have along colonial past and Hollywood didn't help pushing the white people stereotypes. Most of the people you see will never get to leave their city or state. Never give in. India is random and chaotic but you will learn a thing or two about awareness. Only go to spiritual belt if you seek enlightenment! How long are you even in India? Come to Mumbai, city of 26 million people. One can truly get lost in the crowd here. What's next? oh Download uber/Ola (Rikshas and taxi)  and zomato (food) blankit (anything and everything under 20 min) apps. India has solved this fast service industry better than anywhere else in the world. Like I can get anything to my doorsteps within 11 min for $0.50 . At least in major cites.",

I've been treated so well by the majority of Indians I have net on my two trips tom India for a total of 8 months there. The most amount of humanity I've ever seen was at the Kumbh Mela in 2019 in Prayagraj. There must have been around 3-4 million people there and it was an off day.
