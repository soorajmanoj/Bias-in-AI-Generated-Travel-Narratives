      "3:38 - I'd rather use natural products then all the sunscreens available! Just read the amount of increase in skin cancer after the 'inventions' of sunscreen. You're supposed to be a responsible influencer, should promote natural products available in nature. Yes earning money is a necessity, I'd never promote anything that would harm humans or animals or anything on earth! Yes, I travel via planes and my vehicle too which is totally different then promoting something just for money. Hope you realise 🙂 no hate but to make you wake up! My mom loves your videos, and she has fourth stage cancer that's when I got exposed to many products and situations that causes cancer, sunscreens par I've done phd now (hypothetically) 🎗️",
