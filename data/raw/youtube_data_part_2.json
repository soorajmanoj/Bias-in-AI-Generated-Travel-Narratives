Not only this almost all videos of the monkey. \nWhen ever i feel alone , sad , stress thease videos are meet  me and the scene of video makes my time ( i don't know why i feel relief by whatching travel journeys😂)its maybe a reasone its music and its shooting style and also most IMP his editing skill And Dictating The scenario. With the related fellings of of my travel journey. I feel so spiritual when i watch his religious related videos. So much holyness has filled his videos. I cant say his Video as vlog because he not include boring and basic travel life like other do ( ex. telling all meaning less thing of the traveling as ' Abhi guys hum jaipur pohoche and abhi hum yaha se delhi ki taraf jayenge gadi ka haal thoda thik nahi he' What ever  that ) so his videos are very diffrent and very perfectly and professionaly made. I say thank to the monkey for making my and time enjoyable. I will only say that make many such types videos (and feel the holyness in it)  always travel safely and provide happiness.❤❤ 😊",

You must cover more and more train journeys.\nIndian Train Journeys are incredible. They are like life, where you meet several persons on the way and there is always an excitement of who you will meet next and the sadness of separation when you must say goodbye to the co-passengers, whom you didn't know before, they became a part of your journey and next to never meet again.

      "I'm a very frequent train traveller. Extremely introverted in nature and having social anxiety. Whenever I travel, i avoid conversation with nearby people. I put on my headphones. I don't eat from ANYONE even if I'm very hungry, fearing there might be something mixed in the food and i might get robbed. I always book the upper berth cuz if i get lower, I'll have to deal with arguing with people who ask for exchange and i don't want to have that conversation. And in the upper berth, you don't have to deal with getting up and adjusting with middle berth guy for sitting- another conversation avoided.  I always stay on my upper berth and come down only when I've arrived at my station cuz i really don't want any conversation with anyone. Side upper is ideally the best but I'm too tall and my leg hurts having to bend it to fit myself there. \n\nBut damn bro after watching this video I feel like I've missed out on so many experiences... You know what? Ima change. Let's see.",

But back then smartphone didn't exist so never knew that people can even blog on these stuffs. Blogging while brushing, while eating. Even now a lot of people travel via train for 3 days. But for the elite classes like you all these things seem very fancy. And finally people watching this video, please don't order via IRCTC catering they provide worst food. You might be Lucky if you didn't receive stale food .",

I can see now that the train time has been speeded up a bit-- those days it would depart around 2230 Saturday Ex  DBRG and arrive in CAPE at around 1000 on Wednesday.  This is probably due to the change in route. Previously, it would take the Northern Dooar route between Alipurduar and NJP whereas now it takes the southern (still not the mainline chord). Also, previously it would take the ASN_ADRA_KGP route, but now it caresses Kolkata a bit. \nAll in all a memorable experience.\nTo add a bit-- this was my attempt at visiting extremes of Indian Railway network- Ledo in East, CAPE in South, Varvala (Gujarat) in West and Kashmir in the North.

There’s a lot of coastline, there’s mountains,there’s some wildlife.Munnar is a town of kerela and it' took atleast 4 hours to reach from kerela to munnar where has mountains. There’s sometimes people can see cloud inversion in the mountains. And the place are so quite. Then about trip of Thekkady where situated Periyar park. In this place a lot of boat are available for boat trip and also monkeys. A boat safari is such a great way to see wildlife there beacause in the park all animals are tend to come down in water to drink.Then about alleppe, where people can get boat like a house and it would be one of the best cooldest experience for people.

I need to experience this.\" But today, I saw a video about Kerala, India, and it made me realize something important. I've been to the same places shown in the video, but my experience was completely different. It hit me that the quality of a travel experience isn't just about the destination—it's about how much money you can spend. With enough money, even a place like India can look spectacular. For example, the resort featured in the video costs about a month's salary for the average Indian. In the end, it all boils down to how much you can afford to spend. The more money you have, the more beautiful and luxurious your trip will be. Also STOP editing the footage to make it look beautiful.",

      "Kerala guys can go jingoistic praising their green landscape, hills and unusually numerous water bodies, warer falls. It has its escape to an another world sure. It is not without its downsides though, I guess most developing countries do have those downside or tour kill joys. The grand trick is to know where your escape really is, some find it, many dont.\n\nGood video or best video, impressive yet a laid back narration❤, no typical over sell. As pointed out, Taj has become THE tour itenary for most white people for so many years now, good to see kerala and other other distant locations getting equal limelight❤.",

My grandfather built the reservoir (and the dam/hydroelectric project) near there that you briefly showed! The diversity of India is something that most people in the West can't grasp... I sometimes ask them to imagine if Europe was one big country, it would be something like what India with our conglomeration of our states is like. Kerala is about as different from, say, Punjab, as Sweden is from Italy or Poland. It's also as different from its neighboring states as European countries are from theirs. More different actually -- almost every European language uses the same script. We have a different script for each language, and each state has a different language. I'm glad you were able to appreciate our diversity.",

We spent a while in Kerala and this video really brought me back to all those amazing memories of the things we got to do there. Including the tiger reserve and those woven boats on the river. It was so nice to see them again after all this time. If you ever get the chance to go back to India, riding a train is such an adventure. There are men who hop onto the train at every stop with chai /tea and they will do that one meter trick to help cool down the tea quickly. We Americans would try to do it all the time and mostly burnt our hands. 😁",

      "Praise to Jesus Christ. The real fact about Kerala is that 50 years ago, people of Kerala rejected me, when they came to know that my mother is a Jewish Christian lady from American, daughter of multi million oil company in California, USA. The people of Kerala expelled me, Jacob and my brother Mathews in the year 1975 when they came to know that my mother is an British American lady. In the year 1975 people of Kerala and karnataka use to talk against my mother saying British people did a shooting in Mysore and Kochi. people of Kerala never allowed me and my brother to enter Kerala for next 50 years. People of Kerala and Karnataka handed over me Jacob and Mathews to North Indians under Russian leadership since Russia when India and China and Islamic countries came to know that my mother is an American lady. Early 80's and 90's people of Delhi started to torment me taking the exuse of British killing in Punjab province of Jaliawala massacre, which I really don't know exactly what happened During 18th and 19th centuries,  became I was not born on that time period. I was born on 1972 and my parents were born in 1945. This shooting occurred in mysore, kochi and Punjab before India got its independence from British rule. I and my brother was born after the independence. I was 50 years tormented mentally physically spiritually and morally by the above said countries. First up all I, am not happy with people of Kerala and then karnataka beacause the people of Kerala and Karnataka prohibited me and brother enter South India for next 50 years. At that time I narrowly escaped  the death punishments by Indian government. It was Jesus Christ of Nazareth who saved my life. Glory to Jesus Christ Amen +",

The resort team bought my home, they dismantile and rebuilt the same structure in this place... My home is compelety replicated there and 80% of the materials they used there to build the resort, was used from my home. I was not aware of this resort until my family and cousins, took me and my wife there and gifted us a beautiful night there as our wedding gift. It was full of surprise and after a decade, we saw our own home. It was an emotional moment... I have some videos of the same...😊..",

Unlike them you have dressed modestly in our conservative country, and especially conservative state, so I must thank you for that, although towards the end of the video the level dropped a little. This is very notable, especially when it came to swimming you did not exploit your body for views, but rather kept it private as any woman with dignity would.

      "See, This is my message to all foreigners... I have been binge watching different people explore India and I just have like a ton to say... I wanna let my anger out, So just hear me...\r\n\r\nOut of all states in India, Kerala is the cleanest... Has the most amount of english speaking people than any other state and is the the 1st state of India to gain 100% education... Literally anyone you meet will be school passed and not illiterate... And now, for the brown stereotype (brown munde)... Please don't think that everyone is brown or black, You know I myself am white, and i know tons of people who are too... Kerala is the best state in the whole entire India, and that's why it's called \"God's own Country\". \r\n\r\nSorry, If I offended any fellow Indian... I just wanted to let my anger out, seeing all those stereotype from binge watching these things...\r\n\r\nMany american, french, spanish or koreans come to India and make vlogs... but what they are unintentionally doing is going to places, where even us Indians won't go 'cause it's not safe... \r\nAnd You know what they will do? They will upload these videos in such manner that it makes our country look dirty... That everyone is POOR and isn't EDUCATED...\r\nWhy go to such places, and ruin our damn reputation when you can come to a state like Kerala, or Sikkim or any Eastern States as they are also so stunning and beautiful... and again just like Kerala , They are very clean...\r\n\r\nSTOP! stereotyping us and going to places where even we won't and then ruining our country's status... It's because of you guys, that India is thought to be poor... It's because of you guys, that hollywood has normalised stereotypical accents... Not everyone speaks like that you know! I myself and my family do have great accents that sounds like we are from america, but we are not!\n\nWhat Allison said is True: \"The only good thing americans think about India is the Taj Mahal\"\r\n\r\nI HOPE this helps people change their mindset, and i want YOU guys to help spread this message! Use #StopStereotypingIndia and spread this message to all damn social media platforms...\r\n\r\nI wish you a GOOD DAY  <3",

It can lead to serious health problems and sometimes death if not get proper treatment. \nThe hospitals are not at all trustworthy in nature.  The doctor asks for bribes for a good treatment. \nThe road safety is zero in nature and each and every day some road accidents happens where many innocent people loose their lives. \nThe police are not at all trustworthy in nature and are in news for crimes.\nPlease if still anyone is interested to come bear in mind your safety in your hands.",

      "You captured the essence of Kerala beautifully!! Great work!",
      "To be honest when I arrived in Kerala and saw the “God’s own Country” catch phrase from its tourism department, I kind of rolled my eyes. But somewhere along my trip, as I took in the natural beauty and the love from its people, I gradually realized I didn’t even want to leave that place. It truly was God’s own country. It had a way of making everyone feel at home. I still feel like I belong there and I am a malayali (although I don’t speak the language). One of most beautiful places I’ve ever been and that’s not just the nature, but people too.",
      "As someone who has travelled to Europe and South East Asia - the latter especially places like Kerala (India in general) are so much welcoming than places like Italy or France where they frown upon foreigners (especially Americans). In contrast Malayalis (that’s what people from Kerala call themselves) are so thrilled to show you around. Every local I’ve met have been super friendly and helpful. Whenever I’ve been to Europe all I get is contempt for America and some pretentious bs about how everything there is more authentic and better than the rest of the world. In India I felt people appreciate me as a tourist more, they welcome your questions and accept you to a degree that you can’t even remotely experience in France / Italy.",

      "As a Keralite, I'm in utter awe, the way you captured the beauty of my state and presented it in such a pristine method is nothing short of perfection. Like i could take screenshots of any section of the video where you were showcasing the scenery and it would be wallpaper worthy, while i am aware of the beauty that lies deep inside our state ive never had a chance to experience it to such a deep level, since most of my time spent in the innards of the countryside were at tourist hotspots filled with people where you cant really appreciate the scenery as well. So thank you for making this video as it has truly opened my eyes (and my jaws for that matter) also kudos to Kerala's tourism department for sponsoring such a talented individual.",
      "You can try north eastern INDIA 🇮🇳,  HIMACHAL PRADESH ,UTTARAKHAND, RAJASTHAN 😇\n     If you are brave you can kashmir also 🙂 kashmir is generally very beautiful place but most of the people are afraid of this beautiful place 😔 there is risk in some places but most of the state is travel friendly",

There are only a few countries on the planet like India where you can see variety and diversity. The whole United States is monotonous from the east coast to the west coast, there is nothing much to see, compare with India you will see the difference.",

      "India is very diverse in its food, culture , topography, climate, language. Hope u have a pleasant fullfilling wholesome experience.\nI know u many be having doubts about safety and cleanliness. \nA tip from my part -\n1. Wear what the locals are wearing. It will give u a whole different respect and acceptance. Kurtas are the best choice as they are accepted throught out.\nIf not wear jeans and shirts/tops - try avoiding too revealing ones. Not saying ppl are bad . But many might feel more comfortable if u wear things that they have been used to seeing\n2. India has rich ppl , middle class and poor ppl and that separation is evident. Go where the middle class go.. That would be economical and healthy too.\n3. Dont trust everyone. And politely deny ppl asking for selfies\n4. Police are very particular about safety of foreigners.\n5. Most ppl are very welcoming and ready to help. Just avoid the ones that u are doubtful about. If u have doubts or need help its best to ask a family group or a college group than  single individuals. If u feel unsafe stay close to family groups and college groups\n6. Avoid cheap hotels. Go for middle class ones",

      "First of all, I don't think you can experience India in a month. India is so culturally diverse and so big that it will take more than a few months to visit the whole of India. Me, being a Keralite who grew up in the Middle East, I did not know the size of India till I moved to India for higher studies. I mean the culture of India varies even within a state. Like, the culture in the south of Kerala is very different from the culture in central and north Kerala. And when you have 28 States and 8 Union territories, each with a different culture and cuisine of its own, India is a continent of its own.",
