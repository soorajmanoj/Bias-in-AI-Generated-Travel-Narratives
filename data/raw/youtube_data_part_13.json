I woke up every morning around 3 a.m. and got sleepy every day around one p.m. Now that didn't stop me from goung places and doing things but I know it affected my over all mood and well being. I've traveled to Egypt and had no problems adapting. I think it had something to do with the direct plane flight. If I had it to do over, I'd choose a flight with a layover, that was long enough to get out of the plane, walk around, and have a relaxed meal.",

India is a poor country still due to the criminal colonial states but the people in places like Calcutta still smile despite the poverty. However there is no excuse for the richest country USA to have such filthy and depraved slums!!! And these places are dark and gloomy. No one smiles or is helpful and all prey on each other. \n\nNow this privileged American is coming to India to titillate Westerners with the poverty that they created in the first place!!",

The present condition of Calcutta is as a result of these attrocities. Then to show the worst parts of India just to titillate Westerners is itself deplorable and racist.

      "Let's be realistic. India will never be a developed country in it's lifetime. Even if India grows, it will get stuck in the middle income trap forever. India will also face major resource shortage due to overpopulation and face the wrath of climate change. India's resource base isn't large enough to support an economy too large either. Also the West and China can sabotage India in a jiffy if it grows too much. Also most Indians don't have unity and are still backward minded and tribalistic. Corruption and being unethical has become so deep rooted that it's become impossible to fix it. Also, the number of talented Indians leaving India is increasing at an alarming rate every year and many of these Indians who left India brag about India being the next big thing which is extremely comedic. The most mind boggling thing is that even if God comes down from heaven and says that India will never be a developed country,  pa jeets will call him anti Indian and continue living in their fantasy of India being a developed country. Moreover, countries that actually became developed bragged less and did more. India brags more and does less. To conclude, India may improve in some areas, but it always stay a corrupt 3rd world uncivilized banana republic. Hence, forget your dreams of being a developed country pa jeets. India is an utterly failed experiment. \n\nAdios",

By the way, next time please visit the bow-barracks, Armenian colony, and Chinese neighborhoods in Kolkata. You would be able to appreciate the fact that the shared struggle of working people against the colonial powers created a history of co-existence and a sense of belonging in a metro city which unlike the other metro cities of the global north has something to offer for all.",

The whole country (cities, towns, villages) are vastly clean, very modern and futuristic, with zero crime rate and absolutely zero pollution. There are no slumps, shit-holes, ghettos or poor uneducated hungry people in any corner of India. Each and every Indian is well educated, dead honest, equally wealthy and prosperous. Its democratic government is immensely effective, totally clean and corruption-free -- proven by the country's consistent zero unemployment for decades. Its police force holds the reputation of having the highest global standards of integrity, is very clean, corruption-free, humane, competent and professional in their jobs - they don't take bribes, they don't extort money, they don't protect scammers or organized crime, they don't rape young women or beat ordinary citizens brutally on the streets with batons or long rods like what you usually see in bollywood movies. Its judiciary system has stellar track records where judges had solved and closed all legal cases as quickly as the blink of an eye. Public utilities, public transportation, public education and notably its public toilets are all ranked first in the world. And, in case you're not aware of yet, India proudly has the world largest public toilet freely available for everyone - the Ganga River, where people simply jump into the water and conveniently take a bath, pee and poop at the same time in one go.

Its democratic government is immensely effective, totally clean and corruption-free -- as proven by zero unemployment consistently for decades. Its police force holds the reputation of having the highest global standards of integrity, is very clean, corruption-free, humane, competent and professional in their jobs - they don't take bribes or beat ordinary citizens brutally on the streets with batons or long rods like what you usually see in bollywood movies. Its judiciary system has stellar track records where judges had solved and closed all legal cases as quickly as the blink of an eye. Public utilities, public transportation, public education and notably its public toilets are all ranked first in the world. And, in case you're not aware of yet, India proudly has the world largest public toilet freely available for everyone - the Ganga River, where people can conveniently take a bath, pee and poop at the same time in one go.

I don't understand why people still want to portray India as a land of slums, overlooking its highly developed regions. I mean, c'mon it's like visiting a place to exclusively showcase its slums and crowded places. Kolkata in particular, is renowned for its rich heritage, culture, art, literature, music, architecture, and so much more. So its a little weird that you chose not to showcase the other good things.\nI'm not personally offended by this video since it doesn't present anything false, but rather, it's the one-sided portrayal that's concerning. It can create a distorted perception, especially for those who haven't had the opportunity to experience Kolkata or India. If I were someone completely unfamiliar with India and this were the first video I watched, it could leave me with a misguided impression of the entire country for a considerable amount of time.\nI hope you consider showcasing the other side of India as well💜",

      "We are controlled by laws of nature.\r\nThere is a general force of nature, and two opposite forces—bestowal and reception—extend from it.\r\nWe exist between these forces, and both of these qualities affect us.\r\nThen, the question arises: How do we develop under the influence of these forces? Where do we act? Where are we free? How do we accumulate and correlate these two forces within ourselves? How can we build ourselves out of them?\r\nThese are the questions that the wisdom of Kabbalah engages in: how we receive these two forces in an optimal balance, and with their help, shape ourselves so as to resemble the very laws of nature, to arise and reach equivalence of form with the force of bestowal in nature. These very laws gave us the opportunity to control the pace of our progress in accepting them upon ourselves.\r\nThat is the point of our freewill.\r\nHow could we act if we do not have freewill? Who would we be? Would we just be like robots, always under control?\r\nUntil now, we have always been under control. What does it mean?\r\nNature as if injects a drop of egoism–the desire to enjoy at others’ expense–into us, and then it does so a little more, and a little more again, and we then get the impetus to move toward all kinds of egoistic goals. The more our egoism inflates, the more we become willing to move to increasingly gain at the expense of others. Nature constantly squeezes the syringe into us until it eventually infuses us with the full amount of egoism.\r\nOur era is characterized by the syringe of egoism having become completely injected into us, with no more egoism left to inject. That is why we have nowhere left to run.\r\nWhere do we head from here? What do we do?\r\nMoreover, egoism has become global and integral. In the beginning, we felt good because we reached egoistic global connections in the world and thought that everything would be fine. However, when such connections started depending on everyone, we turned out to be nature’s opposite.\r\nAt this juncture, we find ourselves with a major dilemma, and we need to work out what we do about it. Where our fully-inflated egoism coupled with our tightening global connections brings us to increasing problems around the world, today we require a new form of connection-enriching education that would have the ability to guide us on how to change our egoistic connections to altruistic ones. That is the key to a shift to a harmonious and peaceful world.",

      "5 Reasons Why India Is the Dirtiest and the Most Polluted Country in The World\n\nWhat is the first thing that comes to your mind when you hear India? Most people will answer cows, toilets, Bollywood, the Taj Mahal, and high rape rates.\n\nAll these assessments are not wrong, considering that this country, which is located at the South Asian region has more negative sides than positive sides.\n\nIndia is known as a backward and outdated country. Its social problems are very complex.\n\nApart from the issue of rape, most parts of India are slums, which impress people from all over the world, that they are filthy and dirty. This is also proven by surveys from various research institutions which place India at the top of the list of the dirtiest countries with the highest levels of pollutants in the world.\n\n5 reasons India is the most polluted country\n\n1. Poverty\n\nIndia often boasts about its rapid economic development, but a survey by the Rangarajan Committee shows that more than 38% of the population live below the poverty line in 2023.\n\nWith great poverty, most residents live in inappropriate places such as riverbanks, slums.\n\n2. Density\n\nIndia is one of the most densely populated countries in the world with very limited natural resources compared to its booming population. Its population reaches 1.4 billion.\n\nPoverty and density are the 'right' combination to create a slum and polluted environmental situation. Garbage, human waste, animal waste is strewn everywhere on the streets of India, the large number of vehicles and related things certainly make India look so dirty and filthy.\n\n3. Don't care about the surrounding environment\n\nThere is an interesting fact from the primitive lifestyle of Indians. They tend not to care about the surrounding environment.\nThis is because Indians think that public facilities are the responsibility of other people, especially the government. So even though a lot of rubbish has piled up, even though it disturbs the view and causes an unpleasant smell, it's all left alone. Even though outsiders think this is very sad, Indians, whose mindset is backward and uncivilized, have become accustomed to this situation.\n\n4. Caste Mentality\n\nIt is common knowledge that Indian society, which is predominantly Hindu, knows caste in their life. Because of these social norms, people who feel they belong to a higher class tend not to want to do work that is identical to that of people from the strata below them.\n\n5. Government Services\n\nIndia is a very poor country. This results in minimal government services and attention to environmental issues. Such as widening waterways, emptying trash cans and so on.",

To some extent, I love that everything is on the streets. You hardly have to go far from your house for any type of household needs, which is different than most developed nations where you need to take out the car and plan and visit a supermarket seperately. I dont think that kind of beating massage is something citizens do normally. There are every kind of massage , from the one u got to one in a proper salon, to luxury massages. I like that you said they are taking a rest in a cosy spot because I have seen instances where such photographs are clicked and they are posed as homeless, but they r just taking a break from work. Cars, mobiles, adhar id cards, people hooked on to social media, more electricity coverage, better toilets, these r somethings that definitely improved comparing 30 years ago. i love street dosas and kolkata street idli vendors make excellant idly chutney. Yeah Kolkata heat is so sticky and humid. The little tea shops have the best tea, better than cafes and restaurants.

I was fascinated by the culture, the sights, the nature, and the contrast between old and new parts of the city as well as its rich, middle class, and slum areas. My best memory from the trip was one hell of a hike in the Sanjay Gandhi National Park, which is a recommendation I cannot make enough if you ever find yourself in Mumbai, especially the view from the top, which is surreal to say the least! I just concluded a full day in Agra yesterday and looked at a few monuments and local artisan workshops which was very rich and which I also recommend to anyone coming to Agra in addition to visiting the Taj Mahal, of course. My discovery of the massive land of India is still in its infancy and I look forward to the next trip! The one thing I still cannot get used to is the aggressive driving, be it here in Gurgaon (where I'm staying), in Agra yesterday, or in Powai a few years back!

So many modern malls which are also ‘markets’. \n\nThese are the first places that any tourist would visit rather than focus on slums and busy market crowds. \n\nIm not even Bengali.

      "Seriously disappointed from you!!! didn't expect u wd show India this way! is India only about slums& honks?  this is all what you guys see? and selling it as beauty?\n\n I've visited India so many times and witnessed its beautiful architecture ,warmth and helpful people unlike any western country, the mind blowing ancient beautiful temple architecture surviving after thousands of years nd esp. science behind its construction (esp. after numerous cruel invasions, destructions and massive loot by Islamic invaders and colonizers), the bravery of their historic warriors Rani Lakshmi and Chattrapati shivaji maharaj, i learnt last time is just unparalled. the mysteries nd such rich & unique culture and festivals are truly incredible. every time i visit rightly feel y its called gods own land.\n\n U being a Jew should know India was the only country where Jews weren't persecuted and till today owe deeply to them and they still continue to live lovingly. you could at least visit those places and historical sights and show world what it needs today.\n\nThis country has suffered one of worst forms of colonialism in history. It was worlds richest economy contributing 30% alone reduced to mere 3% at its independence. kindly respect its brave path of democracy at that massive poverty and still facing myriad challenges esp. of terrorism..\nwhich i guess deserves at least lil more respect than what you show for war torn regimes.\n\n Next time do visit without biases like presuming Hindu a Muslim and ofc without this colonial lens. Just a suggestion friend.",

You guys always goes to the busy and nastiest places in india, and ignore best places that india has to offer.\nAlso eat from street vendors and get food poisoned. U can easily avoid it by eating from good hotels and restaurants, just google map u can see ratings and reviews there and choose the best restaurants to eat. \nU guys always choose Delhi and Kolkata when visiting india, which has the most traffic, population, nasty food etc..\nEach state has their own best destination to visit and always ask the locals of the state about the best place that state has to offer. (Because india got hidden  gems that is only known to the locals)\nIf u follow this u can see another India trust me.",

Infact you go to the most dirtiest countries and show a positive image about them.. I am unsubscribing you and I wish you loose all Indian subscribers. Thank you !!",

      "I challenge you to spend $500 a day in Kolkata and see for yourself that there is more to the city than just slums. Your whitewashed American brain may be shocked at how much we have to offer. India is not a monolithic society like small population countries. You have traveled the world, so we expected you to be more open-minded. But you have proven us wrong. After all, Indian slums give you more views, so they must be worth more money.",

Also you were my inspiration once but not anymore. You sound way to elite noww despite visiting all countries.\n\n\nMoreover you'll spend thousand in Europe to experience bare minimum hospitality but won't spend a dollar for same in India and will do the poverty porn.\n\n\n\nEnjoy India at its fullest by spending and then see.

      "While I appreciate some parts of the video at the same time, It's deeply unsettling to see content creators exploit the struggles and hardships of others for views. Displaying impoverished areas and communities not to raise awareness but to showcase them as a spectacle for a privileged audience is not only disrespectful but outright dehumanizing. This is poverty porn. We must demand better, encouraging content that respects the dignity of all individuals and portrays communities with the depth, nuance, and respect they deserve.

Also, from your video on southern India a few years ago you seem to have liked it and you even mentioned things you loved about northern India.",
      "Thank you for visiting India and Kolkata specifically but Kolkata is much more than what you showed. You particularly chose the busiest, chaotic and backward parts of the city. Not sure what your intention was bit honestly there's a lot more to show about Kolkata than how you presented. For people who don't know about the city will think the entire city is like this. Showing poverty seems to give the western people some sort of satisfaction. Hope you come up with a part 2 of this video showing the developed side of the city as well. Even a city like NYC has it's flip side. Will you have the guts to show it as well? Hope you prove me wrong.",

You visited only chaotic wholesale market place of Kolkata, Kolkata is the economic hub of entire Eastern India, so obviously it has large market place, and that is  burobazar. You did not even visited two important synagogues in Kolkata which were just few metres away from the place you were standing. That two are Maghen David and Beth El Syangogue. Kolkata is called \"Cultural capital of India\". You did not visit India's one of the largest book market, College Street. You did not explore colonial past of Kolkata, and its colonial architecture, such as Writers Building, Victoria Memorial, Metcalf Hall, Town Hall, St Paul Cathedral, Metropolitan Building. You did not explore spiritual places of Kolkata like Kalighat, Dakshineshwar and Belur Math. Kolkata is diverse in each and every aspect, from culture to architecture to religion. Oh, I forget to mention New Town of Kolkata. That is the modern version of the city. That part of the city is completely opoosite to the part you shown in the video.

I know you posted this a little while ago, but I hope you have found safety and healing after these situations ❤\n\nMy dream is to travel to every country in the world (that is safe). I now know that I can not and will not go to India by myself. Thank you so much for being vulnerable and for sharing your story x",

I was once thinking of taking my blonde English girlfriend on holiday to see family. Let’s just say I’m glad I didn’t. That’s coming from a former professional bouncer and bodyguard so I know how to look after myself and others.",

      "why everyone there obsessed with taking a photo ? very odd sry that happened to you.",
      "tv serials and cinima portrait white indian women as an open character with humor so normal poor population get that image about white skined and rich women , this damages the and stops the natural interaction between men and women regardless of their appearence . so cinima decides the way we look at women and interact with women in india",

Kerala, the southern most part of India. Its a heavan on earth with greenery everywhere, water falls,backwaters etc... safer  for women....    Sumptuous loval food etc....

Here, people only know their rights but not their duties. Sometimes, it gets me into the puzzle that are we really progressing or just under the name of progress heading in the wrong direction.",

I use to know women who traveled alone to India for yoga and spiritual reasons and they never mentioned any serious issues being there, but that was in the 90's, 2000's and early 2010's. Anyways, I am glad you made it back home safely.",
      "Never ever think about travelling to India if you are a fair skinned girl, western, Japanese or Korean, they will rape you!!\nThe Indians are so obsessed with whites that they will go to any extent, they will never consider consequences, all they care is about havengs*x with a white girl. \nPlease please, never go to India. Many Spanish, Korean, Japanese, British and Russian girls have been gang raped and killed.\nStay safe, stay away from India.",

      "Interesting. In the 1960s and 1970s many young women went on hippie trips to India from the UK. They told me India was happy, free and safe. And the best Gurus lived there. (They had listened to so many Beatles records!) And they said you could find your Hindu god by smoking lots of pot and partying. I never believed them. I visited India in UK navy, and I saw a different India. And I never believed those girlie hippy travellers fairy stories.",
      "I am not sure why and how some people in india is still overwhelmed with white people and why they want to take pictures. It is definitely weird, but I am from Gurugram and there are two parts of Gurugram. If you visit the outskirts, you will have eyes all over you however if you stroll through the posh areas like dlf, people will hardly notice you or give any importance, even if you are wearing short dresses. \n\nI just want foreigners to know that you need to be very careful when making your itinerary\n\nIf you wish to visit India and be safe, I am sorry to say but this is harsh reality; if you wish to visit india and stay safe please do not consider this trip as a cheap vacation. \n\nPlease opt for reputed hotel chains like Lemon tree or Hilton and stop visiting Rajasthan or Old delhi, your itinerary should be correct and contact me if you need any help with that. I will do it free of charge as I want every single visitor to be safe. \n\nI am a Hindu and I believe atithi devo vabha. I am ashamed to hear your shocking experience and from the bottom of my heart I say sorry for those illiterate creatures of our country. \n\nFor Indian guys like me who are ashamed to hear about this incident, please be vocal if anything like this happens infront of you.\n\nYes I know that there might be politically powerful people involved but do you really think that perverts like these who want a photo with a white girl is anything power person? Please stop assuming and start being vocal.",
      "It's heartbreaking seeing all the ordeal you went through in your eyes. My wife and I visited India in 2005. We just hired  driver and a car, assuming we would be OK, but it just took us one day to realize the driver was too interested in taking us to certain places. Having a word or two with the driver worked out just fine, but the minute we got off the car, our day became a kind of a gymkhana, trying not to be scammed every step we took. That was our experience, that's what I'm saying. I remember relaxing in Orcha for the only time. It's a shame, because India is an amazing country worth visiting, but when our plane touched down in Spain, we knew we would never fly back again. Time is scarce, the world is too big, and one trip on survival mode is more than enough. We wish you all the best.",

I have been India couple of times but have no intention of going back, going to be frank complete shit hole.",
      "I backpacked alone as a female traveler for 2 months in India when I was 22 years old. I visited all the mentioned places plus some. It was by far the hardest country to travel in I’ve ever tried even to this date 13 years later and 70+ countries visited. So many inappropriate comments from men, heckling and I’ve left hotels/hostels sooner rather than planned due to feeling very unsafe from the male staff. However, I also truly had an amazing trip and do not regret going. I travelled aloned, mainly stained in hostels, planned my own trips and transport which means I never had to deal with “guides” or “drivers”. Just normal tuktuk and taxi drivers, took the train on the third class (packed with locals with rats running around the floor) and felt completely safe. \n\nI know I was lucky that nothing too bad happened to me. But to be fair, I met mostly normal people on the street which were very kind. Yes, cat-calling, being followed and offered opium straight up on the street is a strange experience. Would I recommend India for anyone? Absolutely not. For an experienced traveller who is willing to take the risk? Yes, for sure, it’s a stunning country. Would I go back? Nope, too hard and not worth the risk for me any more. I fully recommend going to Nepal, Bhutan or Sri Lanka instead. Felt the most safe in those countries - even more than SE Asian countries.",

      "This infuriates me. I’m so sorry you went through these horrific things. It’s simply inexcusable.\n\nI spent some parts of my early 20s wearing raincoats on my way to college (it wasn’t raining) because men used to harass me and try to touch me at signals.\n\nLike you, I felt way safer in Mumbai and now the southernmost parts of Goa where eve teasing isn’t as common.\n\nIndia needs a major cultural overhaul with regards to respecting women and basic civic sense (all of which ironically was already part of the cultural heritage of ancient India).",
      "The truth about traveling to India \n\nIndia is the most awesome country to travel but there are some black spots that you should avoid. \n\nThese spots include: Delhi, agra and jaipur. \n\ni saw your entire video twice, taking notes of everything that you said. \n\nAnd unfortunately u walked right into these spots. \n\nYes, what happened to you was wrong\nand no matter who it is (man or woman) this should not had happened. \nI m really sorry that you have to experience it. \n\nBut that being said, I really want you to know that India is not just Delhi, Agra or jaipur \n\nIndia is so much more. \n\nThe reason you wanted to come back to India was because of Kerla. \n\nif you say no to India, then you are doing injustice to kerla. \n\nu also had a wonderful time in mumbai. \n\nAlso, if someone really wants to travel to India, then here are the places I recommend. These places are heaven on earth with 100% woman's safely:\n\n1. Ladakh \n2. Sikkim \n3. Nagaland (and the other sister states) \n4. Kerla \n5. Andaman\n\nif you want a Youtube video on this, then I recommend watching:\nTravel with Nom Nom(I traveled across India) \n\nif you want a single female solo travelers safely and experience point of view, then I recommend watching:\nNatalia's passport(Solo travel in India) \n\n\nPlease don't delete this comment, so that\nif someone reads it, then they will experience the real india.\n\nIf you agree to my opinion, then please like this comment so that it comes on top.",
      "No human, let alone a girl and at that a solo female traveler should ever travel to Indian. I am a man and I can handle a lot tough situations, having travelled in 120+ countries which includes around 25+ countries in Africa. However, India has been the only place where I felt scared for my life and encountered so much aggression from just the normal people on the streets. My conclusion about India is that t is a society that is filled with hate, aggression and racism. I will never ever travel there and I will never ever recommend to anyone and especially to female travelers. Avoid Indians wherever you see them anywhere in the world as these behaviors are built into their thinking and society as a whole. The more wealthy and 'educated' the more jaded their world view is.  Indian are savage beings. AVOID THEM at all cost.",
      "My experiences were even worse, extremely dangerous. No regard for women, even in a group or with anybody!  One of the very worst experience of my life  was to travel in India.",
      "Glad we separated from India",

      "The problem is when solo travellers, especially women travel to India. It is not an easy place to visit as most places on the sub continent are. Unfortunately we do not have the B&Bs as there are in the West, where a standard is laid down. In India standards are inspected by government clerks and many people who have them have no idea how to run them. I have met many single women and men travelling alone and we have enjoyed meeting others as well as my friends they are introduced to. Like me there are millions of Indians who have had similar experiences. Living in the UK for the last 20yrs, I showed this video to some of the Brits  here and they all felt that this She had this experience because she did not prepare of a solo trip herself. \n\nTravelling alone denies many of a chance of meeting genuine, hospitable and polite Indians or their family. They speak the same language as the visitors. Like any other countries, even in the educated West there are no go areas but on one's own how does one realise this. In fact our own women know where they can go alone. .",

      "Really sorry that you had to go through all this while you were in India. I wish you had an indian contact who could have been your help during these troubled times. India is b'ful and safe at many places and unsafe at others even for Indians. My suggestion to anyone booking a tour to india especially solo would be to book through trusted travel agents. And not just any random 1st/2nd option google throws at you. In this day and age you have ample resources to search for a highly trusted travel agent. For females I'd suggest to book through female travel agents who have a whole team of highly qualified and trained female tour operators and guides. For e.g. WOW(women on wanderlust) please always a local known point of contact and have them know ur itinerary in advance. Keep in contact with them while in India.",

Honestly all us Indians aren't like that at all but  just few handful scums create real bad impression of India in front of the whole world. It would have been better if you would have known someone there and would've travelled with their support but anyway can feel the pain you must've gone thru & good that somehow you could escape those circumstances safely. Best wishes to you !! 🎉🎉",

Another day, the same Indian guy sat next to me in class and started pulling the strings on my pants and shoelaces… I had to talk to the instructor and then student services for this to have him sit apart from me. And mind you this is a diploma program in college and the guy was 25 and his friend was close to 30. We are not teenagers or even that young. I am an exchange student in Canada and I’ve never had this kind of experience in my country(Turkey).",
      "Visited India twice. First time backpacking from Calcutta to Nepal. I was travelling with a seasoned traveller. In Calcutta a man got friendly as we ate dinner. He wanted my travel friend to either sell me or swap me with the woman who stood behind him. I learned that she was from a Burmese state. Probably sex trafficked. This was 1979. We rebuffed him, I was helpless to help her, will never forget her steely survival spirit. Otherwise, the trip went OK.\nEarly 1980s I spent 3 months in northern India on a seed buying trip with my boyfriend.  I wore a wedding ring and we told people we were married.  When I walked around the rural city on my own I had problems.  A police officer chatting me up. Pebbles being thrown at me with hissing noises.\nWhy visit a deeply sexist and corrupt country?",

It's not a statement generalizing all Indians but it's mostly true in almost all parts of India especially the Northern part - Jammu Kashmir, Haryana, Punjab, Delhi, Uttrakhand, Himachal, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan to some parts. You need to avoid Bihar and Jharkhand at all costs if you are travelling alone men or women irrespective. Research very carefully before you travel to northern India.\n\nThe safer places to visit are eastern part of India like Meghalaya, Manipur, Nagaland, Mizoram, Arunachal. People are more empathetic and the system is organized. Southern India is more okayish in terms of travelling solo.\n\nThere are plenty of places to travel around the world. India is over hyped, there's nothing here except for some natural beauty at some parts of the country. If you are travelling to gather spritual experience then you'd probably be scammed. It's all a sham. God has left this country very long ago.",
      "Why wre Indians like this?",
      "It doesn’t surprise me at all, India is an extremely poor country and as a result people lack culture and education.

I want to help you and others make sense of this issue. In India, white people—especially women—are often seen almost like celebrities, and men sometimes want photos with them, somewhat like paparazzi who hounded Princess Diana. Many female celebrities in the US face similar struggles and mental health challenges, which is very unfortunate, with Diana’s tragic story being the saddest example. One of my Russian friends in Goa manages this by charging 500 rupees per photo and asking people to form a line, with no touching allowed. This strategy can work in some cases. Traveling solo is a very Western idea, and many parts of India remain culturally centuries behind. That said, I know several white female friends who travel solo here and handle these challenges quite well. I have face similar situation in China when people and school kids wanted to take photos with me and my African friend.",

      "Hey, brown Indian guy right here 👋. I totally see where you’re coming from and even agree with you a 100%. The problem here is, no matter how hard you try to “educate” or help people here, it’s all to no avail.\n1. India is REALLY corrupt. Money and power runs everything here, even the judicial and political systems. Add that to the major divide between the economic status (huge gap between rich and poor), you’ll get to know how the whole system works.\n\n2. Rules and laws are made, and are broken by the ones who are supposed to protect them. And again, lack of proper education and enforcement for generations has led to multiple generations of families who don’t pay any heed to education at all, even if it’s readily available to the newer generations, hence continuing the loop. \nPeople break laws like they’re meant to be broken, there’s no safety net for anything at all here. Be it road safety laws, cleanliness and hygiene related issues, basic civic sense or any other laws. Funny thing is even a lot of the “people who protect the laws” don’t even know which laws exist, and they operate on bribery. \n3. Female safety issues. Well, I don’t even need to say much, the whole world knows about this. Even females born in India are reluctant to go anywhere after dark in most places here, let alone tourists. Parents don’t teach their daughters to face the world but “stay at home after dark” or “be home before it’s dark”. Surprisingly, sons are never taught to behave properly with females or to never look at females in bad faith. It’s just the daughters that suffer scrutiny at home and lack of safety outside. Problem isn’t just education, problem is the generations of lack of dignity towards females and the biased approach of parents and even teachers towards children based on their genders. Problem is the baseless stereotypes that have been made and carried forward for centuries that create a false impression of females being weaker and men being the dominant force in families, extending all the way to political structures and social strata. \n\nIndia is a F’ed up place to live. As simple as that. Some people will say “not all of india”, but I disagree. If you’re a tourist coming to India, I respect you and pray that you’re safe and have a great experience. \n\nHere’s a trick, get in contact with some good educated family in India and if possible, live with them at their home when visiting and visit places with them. It’ll be a WAYY better experience.",
      "Being an Indian man, I’m really sorry you had such an experience. As much as our country advertises and shows off the nature, the culture and everything, the most basic of things such as education, civic sense and basic dignity are not taken care of. \nVisiting this country will show you both extremes, probably some amazing places, amazing people and amazing food, but will mostly leave a bitter taste in your diary of experiences because of the unruly behaviour, lack of even basic safety, non-existence of “consent” and baseless stereotypes. \nI especially empathise with tourists who travel here from places where such things are uncommon or don’t exist because for such people, India is a place where expectations are not just broken, they’re fully reversed to the bad side of things. \nThe very small number of Indians who are able to get well educated, develop a civic sense and respect towards everyone generally just leave India because this is a black hole that can suck you in at any moment and there’s no coming out.",

Harvard, Oxford, Stanford and many other universities have studied for a long time the negative effects of pornography. It increases aggression and when couples with the fact that the vast majority of porn is Euro-American, presenting all women as being open and available for fantasies. The effect of this on the brain on a mass scale for a country that doors not teach any form of sex education, is a bad bad influence.",

We won't even let any women go out alone without someone else, and we actually look similar to Indians. \n\nI don't wanna talk about religion or cows or anything else. That's for them. I won't step on there religion because I disagree with what's happening to us in India. I also won't say that all of even the majority is like this, It's actually the minority but the minority is so loud that it sounds like the majority. I think this is a cultural and behavioural issue. The whole country is built on hustle culture, I think the Indian government should stop eating all that money that they tax there citizens for and actually use it to improve living conditions, education in rural areas, healthcare, the job market and developing undeveloped area's of India instead of distracting Indians with Hindu nationalistic propaganda to hate other countries to keep them distracted from the real issues.",

I don't know if these guys were Indian or not but about 7 guys just started staring at my girlfriend and I mean STARING. They all stopped talking to each other and just looked at her and then one snapped a photo of her. I was so confused at what was happening it was so bizarre. Seriously, in a lot of cultures men don't know how to act around women. We've had issues in places like Montreal where groups of Indian men would hang out at the local public swimming pool and just stare at the women. It got so bad even the news covered the issue.",

I find it really unhelpful that some comments are just saying to go somewhere else instead-the point is that everywhere should be safe for women to travel without having to have a male companion.

I would advise every female traveller to come with a companion or a group and even then only come to India if you know an Indian that you can Trust. Because that would take 90% of your worries out of it and only then you can truly explore our ancient culture and cities. Again Sorry for your Experience. Hope many viewers see this comment and make decisions accordingly. I myself am a finance guy so i personally don't provide any tourism business.

Which is why the UK and Europe is crumbling. Don't believe it? Go visit London. Go visit Paris. Travel throughout Europe. Travel the world. Compare the men. Compare the cultures. Yes, there are wonderful people everywhere in every nation. And some of the most darling souls, you may find abroad. But not all cultures are equal. And that's just the cold truth. But there are some very foolish ppl among us in the West, who would prefer never to give offense, even at the cost of their own individual safety and the broader public's safety.

On our walk through the Mumbai chaos and traffic we had to stop to cross at an intersection,out of nowhere a big group of men swarmed around us and started touching me and tugging at my backpack. At first I thought they were trying to steal my bag. I screamed and my boss shouted at them, I remember him saying hey personal space mates but nobody got it. Then they were touching me, I felt hands grab my legs and somebody groped my breast and a hand on my butt. My boss grabbed onto me close and we ran to the office from there.

There are areas in my hometown that I would not visit after dark without an extremely good urgent reason, even with a firearm.\n\nIt's a sad fact that the world cannot be assumed to be a safe place. I'm glad you are safe and letting others know about the situation in India. As a parent of two girls I spent many years emphasizing to them, \"It shouldn't be that way, but what is, is, and what ain't, ain't\". The world isn't what you want it to be, try to change it too much at your peril.\n\nI hope the fear and trauma you experienced will fade quickly.\n\nIs India the worst you have experienced?",

She hasnt been back to india since then. Its not a place I would go - and Im male. \n\nIve seen some recent videos of a young korean woman in india (probably why your video came up in my feed).

Travelling independently means you'll be staying at traveller hotels/hostels where you'll be surrounded by other travellers, who on the whole will look out for you.

Being together with other people so much felt pretty safe, and we were rarely targets for groups of men (other than a bit of cat-calling). I had a great time.",

After that so so so so so deteriorated.... i never seen people acting so badly... ...  I NEVER  wear any revealing clothing either... i know better.

But I'd never want to travel to India again and never ever suggest any female friend of mine to travel there or even be friends with Indian men. I don't have any hatred as such but I'm just stating facts. It feel its very unsafe for women. very very unsafe. I'm not just talking about any major incident that might happen to them, just generally too, India needs a culture change to change the mentality of men. Its very sad to see their thinking regarding women. Even now I'm working in Africa and most of the Indian men treat African girls here at work or somewhere outside as 3rd class person. No respect, no empathy, nothing. They just outright think, if they give them money they have to sleep with them and ALL of them will as per them. How pathetic is that? They even talk like if we give this girl some money, she'll have sex with all of us. What kind of mentality is that? Its so hard to understand. Having said that I'd never want any Indian men who I don't know very closely to be around the women I know.

When I travel to India, I’m usually on high alert too. Even in the nicest hotels, support isn’t always guaranteed and bystanders don’t always intervene in uncomfortable situations. Safety also varies widely depending on where you are. Mumbai, for instance, tends to feel comparatively safer because it’s a larger, more cosmopolitan city, whereas Delhi has had ongoing issues with women’s safety. Goa, despite its tourist appeal, has its own set of challenges. Generally, the further south you go, the more relaxed and safer it can feel, but awareness and caution are still important everywhere. India is not safe for women travellers. I had to check my hotel door multiple times once because I was being pursued by a random person at a hotel in Delhi. It was a 5 star hotel and he just rocked up asking for photos and would not go away. Indian men don’t spare you online either. This is a truthful lived experience and thanks for sharing it .",

In China if men acted like this in public they will be taken away and disappeared for years or maybe forever.  China prides itself as the world's most civilized, educated, modern, and the safest.  Why go to this place India, woman?!!  It's dangerous there!",

I lasted 2 days before I got the heck out of there, with no desire to ever return. I've visited 47 countries thus far and by far, India is the worse.",

Personally, I'm a man and I won't visit India if it was the last godforsaken place on Earth. Woman should not travel to places like this alone.

      "tldr; No, its not safe. Most of India is still the third world (~ 90 %). So if you randomly throw a dart in India, you'll end up in almost 1800s living conditions (average person leading a life on less than 150 USD per month). When daily life is like hunger games for most people, the normal \"human\" things that people take for granted in the West are a luxury which is only accessible by a small number of people. So, if you know anyone in the top 10%, you'll have decent time. If you know anyone in the top 1%, you'll have the best time of your life.

Groping, harassment from tour guides, almost being mobbed, guys trying to push their way into the hotel room.  It feels almost strange to talk about it, but I felt so consistently unsafe I have since warned anyone considering a trip not to go without a male travel companion.

      "My first night in India is a classic example of why women should never travel to India alone.  On arrival at a University guesthouse I was greeted by a fellow academic.  She was attractive and suggested we could go out for an evening meal.  Obviously she was bored of eating alone.  So after showering I emerged from my apartment and she from hers next door.  And the outfit she wore didn't hide her femininity.  I said to her that's a bit too much for conservative Indian attitudes isn't it.  She laughed because we were going to a 5 star hotel anyway.  So we hailed a tuk tuk, autorickshaw.  The ride lasted about 30 seconds.  He wasn't watching the road he was watching her half exposed breasts in the mirror and we crashed  headlong into a bullock in the road.  We got out laughing and hailed another Tuk tuk- this one was severely damaged.  Years later I went to Goa with my wife and she was constantly propositioned by men despite my presence.   And I spoke to many female backpackers who suffered horrendous experiences and sexual assault.  So No don't travel to India as a solo woman or any Islamic country for that matter.",

      "As an Indian, I am so sad listening to this! I have travelled solo in India, but may be due to my already cautious nature and knowledge of different parts of India, I have not had very bad experiences in there. Also people in cities are more cunning. In my experience villagers were so good, around 8years back, when I travelled. Also south is complete opposite of north of India and is much better. It is so sad and this experience should not be happening to tourists.",

Iran is fabulous and it's people are not only civilized but extremely polite and hospitable. Yet MSM promotes India as this haven and Iran as some sort of terrorist country one should fear. The reality is quite the opposite. I have never felt safer than in Iran...not even in the West. The people there kept asking if they could be of any help or if I needed anything. Were a situation as the horrific one you described have happened in Iran, I'm sure the people there would have interfered. But the thing is, a situation like that would never happen there...the people are just too cultured and civilized to treat women like that. I don't recommend anyone travelling to India, especially women. I was overjoyed to leave.",
      "A shameful video. I am ashamed. I grew up in Australia but from Bangladesh. Seeing something like this makes me seethe with rage. I am a male but I got harassed too when I went to visit Bangladesh. The worst part is it seems systemic. I've had several girlfriends that wanted to visit the sub continent but I always deflected it as I didn't want them to experience this. I feel for you my friend. Next time, go with some men or friends and try to get a good guide and basically get them to escort you everywhere. Don't let them just be your guide. Let them do everything, pay them a bit extra but you won't get ripped off, they will take care of the scammers etc. The problem with the sub continent is the over population and you don't realize that not all of the people there are scammers. Over population means heaps of scammers and poor people that when they see a white girl, they go wild. It's like as you said, a purse waiting to be exploited. Muslim countries are different as it's extremely frowned on not to have hospitality to guests. Try Pakistan out. It's completely different I've heard.",

What my colleague was also incredibly nieve to were the advances complete strange men would make towards her. It got so bad, I ended up spending the majority of the time there holding her hand or putting my arm around her shoulders, trying to ward random men wanting to touch her hair or hold her hand. I'd NEVER recommend any woman travelling there on their own. Ever.",

      "No, India is not safe for women and in particular white women. Was there for over a month and travelled with my son and a friend sponsored Indian. So was safer than most white skinned females. First day met two young Americans who were very unhappy as men shouted from cars at them, honk their horns, follow them in cars and on foot. Generally the same experience as Pheobe. Also met a well travelled women from Rome that lived in London, and she left after 3 days as every time she left the hotel at least 5 men were following her. It is such a shame as, although I was safe travelling with two males, it was apparent that even the sponsored Indian saw me as a second class citizen. India is like stepping back in time. Fascinating and visually different from anywhere I had previously visited. But, like this lady it’s the men who make you feel uncomfortable and vulnerable, as they doesn’t respect women at all. Shame as it could be a top travel destination but it is too dangerous for white women. We travelled to Deli, Jaipur, Agra, Jodhpur and Jaisalmer and stayed in everything from a flat run as a B&B in Deli to the Rambagh Palace in Jaipur in which my room was the most beautiful I have ever stayed in. Large, huge seated bay window with trees loaded with orange scented flowers, large bathroom, with shower and separate bathing room, writing desk, massive bed, sitting area, huge wardrobe and all for a fraction of the Intercontinental in Lijiang China. Will never forget. So sad as it could be an amazing destination but not at the expense of safety.",

Thousands of YouTubers, both men and women, have praised the country for its safety, even when walking alone after midnight. Many even describe China as one of the safest destinations in the world for solo travelers. Just search on YouTube for “Is China safe for women?” and you’ll find plenty of firsthand accounts.",

In Mumbai in the local train unless I travel into the ladies compartment, I don't feel easy. Since 20 years I'm flying to India every now and then because of my husband. And every time I come back, I know that's not a place I want to ever live. I like some parts of the culture, including music and partially traditional clothing, but, from outside. Pakistan? Yes, any time. The way those people treated me there, like a gift of God, the guest that I was, was amazing. I also have to say that I don't go jeans and T-shirts in this countries, ever. It's mostly traditional clothing, for my safety. I stumbled upon this video of yours just because of a YouTube suggestion and I'm so very sorry for your experience.",

      "I was in India three times in the late 1970s and experienced it all on a much lower scale, harassment from people trying to sell something or Western women occasionally being harassed while seeking company from other Westerners for protection. At that time there were already reports of Dowry murder cases and women who had acid shed on them. Nevertheless, as a Westerner you were not nearly as harassed as is described in today's reports. People were more curious about young travelers from the West and hospitable. But what was already noticeable back then was the extreme, Victorian-like sexual repression of society. Young men asked for porn magazines. There were early reports of ultrasound scans of pregnant women who did not want female babies. There was also a mixture of inferiority complexes and a lack of distance towards people from the West. I think that the Internet, social media and smartphones have exacerbated the situation for Western travelers in recent decades. A strange mix comes together. On the one hand, pride in India's own rapid rise, combined with rising Hindu nationalism and decolonization discussions, an aggressive mix. People see the West in decline and, on the one hand, envy it for its free way of life and at the same time pity it. At the same time, Indian society is still extremely strict on gender issues. Premarital relationships are still undesirable and marriages are extremely expensive. Young men without girlfriends have a hard time making contact with the opposite sex, are extremely uptight and sexually frustrated, consume Western porn and appear in mutually encouraging groups of men who become a danger to single girls and women. In addition, there is still a persistent misogynistic attitude in society. All of this seems to Westerners like an anachronism that they cannot cope with. Our emancipatory movements have led to widespread gender equality and respect for other cultures, accompanied by a decolonial guilty conscience that makes us vulnerable. We do not realize that the Internet, which has no borders, with its porn industry resulting from liberalism, has led to great desire for such freedoms and at the same time to contempt for Western values. Western women are seen as available, which is a huge misconception. Liberal excesses like the porn industry in the West are massively misunderstood as the sexual availability of women to sexually frustrated men. They do not understand the concept of equality and mutual respect between the sexes and western female pride and female self-confidence . The West must be careful that its values are not undermined and must still find a concept to defend these values internationally without instructing other cultures.",

      "I hope this comment doesn't get moderated. First and foremost, I'm sorry you had a terrible experience. I would very much like to know what travel agency you used, cause others, if they choose to go, probably should avoid that travel agency. \n\nIn terms of being sexually harassed online, months after the trip, that is disgusting, and I do condemn it, without exception. \n\nI would like to say however, that as with any country, travelling is a mixed bag and some have a good and others have a bad experience. Would I suggest travelling to India alone? Probably not. But I would say that for any country. And if I personally would do that, I'd be very careful about potential pitfalls (not casting any aspersions on the breadth of your research). I've had bad experiences on LA & Detroit cause I ended up in the wrong neighborhoods, and most of middle America, cause many people don't want a brown person around. My aunt got her passport stolen in Madrid. All this to say that experiences vary, and can be good or bad, but I'd be careful about generalizing that over a billion people. \n\nPersonally, I've traveled to India with my wife (who's white and American), and she had no issues. This is also partially because I have a good knowledge of the country and it's cities and know what to avoid and when.\n\nAs for all the people calling out the horrific atrocities that have happened in India, that again, is not unique to that country. It is not difficult to find recent cases (2020 onwards) of heinous acts against women in the US. I don't think anyone would argue that there shouldn't be any travel to the US because of that. Let's not even talk about racially motivated crimes, police brutality, and shootings. Would one feel ill at ease travelling to the US for that? Before anyone calls it out as such, this is not whataboutism, cause I'm not saying the crimes are pardonable cause it happens everywhere. Rather, that we have to be consistent in our standards.",

In general, the idiot lot harrasses people with camera more,I have noticed, perhaps assuming them token to open interaction(I know its beyond disgusting,but its true). So try to travel without a camera in hand,your privacy will be respected more & No’s will be accepted.\n4. I know its weird but having a male partner or friend along will make your life smooth in 3rd world countries like India where most are uneducated & have got internet without manners.\n5. Abusing privacy is a serious cutural deficit,I as a male encounter on daily basis,I cant imagine what a female might go through.\n6. Thats why well to do indians either go out of the country or build a totally secure private environment for their females so they can live & breathe peacefully. An essential part of which is summoning a male member for most or all of their travelling.\nWe have gotten used to it. Its hard but its our fate.",

      "phoebe I am glad that you made it safely back home. It must be a truly traumatic experiences lecherous men lurking all around and feeling helpless in the sea of cold and crude patriarchally toxic men. That said, let me share my experiences of 25 years living in Delhi as a man from the North East of India, from the first day till the day I left even Indians who look different are not free from harassment of all kinds.\n\nThis toxic culture against women particularly women tourist is aggravated by the failure of the law enforcement agency. Why I say this? Of all the racially motivated murder, rape, molestation, harassment against North East women, not even one case had been investigated and justice delivered to victims. Prejudice and stereotypes about the North East are used to justify racial abuse and violence. Even Delhi Police in its 2008 guidelines to the North East People echoed this prejudice. Delhi Police guidelines advised North People to not cook and eat 'smelly' North East food. As a result since the last 2-3 decades lumpen elements and goons have picked up a culture of impunity, a conclusion that they can get away with anything done to the North East people in Delhi and other parts of India.\n\nIn 2013  a north East youth from Arunachal Pradesh was beaten to death in broad daylight  in Amar Colony, South Delhi a place where I stayed as a college student in the early 1990s. Enough was enough, North East people protested and the UPA govt. set up a committee to examine the racial crisis. Before the committee was actually set up, ethnic civil society organisations were invited by the Home Ministry of the governement of India to New Delhi. A friend of mine who worked in a Naga organization in Kohima asked me to write a draft note to be presented to Mr. P. Chidambaram the then Home Minister. \n\nThe draft note had five points but the key idea was 'Joint-Policing' to bridge the cultural gap. Delhi Police simply was understaffed and had little idea about the North East people and their culture. Police complaints by North East people barely made it to the prosecution stage due to the shoddy investigation. The department of SPUNER or (Special Police Unit Delhi Region) emerged from the South Delhi murder case and the draft note I mailed to friend who called back to say that all the five points had been submitted to the minister.\n\nThe point being, right thinking people in India need to ask the question whether it is time to have a new law and a special police force to address the harassment of women/tourists, foreigner or non-foreigner and the fallout of this crisis, India as hell-hole for foreign tourist.  If the law is seen to be weak and the force lazy, people tend to think they can get away again and again after committing crimes. In the North East people case the law was seen to be weak and lazy. If the govt wants to genuinely ensure India as a safe tourist destination and project positive image globally, the lecherous and toxic lumpen culture must be firmly dealt with.",

In general, South India is considered safer compared to some parts of North India. People in the South are often more welcoming and protective toward newcomers.\n\nUnfortunately, some regions in North India are known for scams, and not only do they target foreign tourists, but even visitors from South India are often scammed. This is a harsh reality we must acknowledge and work to change.\n\nIndia has many beautiful and safe places, but travelers must remain cautious and informed.

Indians do take advantage of kindness of foreigners and think it's ok to show bad behaviour. i was raised in a good family and my mom has always thought me to respect people, I'm grateful to her for raising me that way, the problem is that if I see an incident like this in front of my eyes, I become powerless to stand up, coz if I try to save one woman the perpetrators will then try to harm me and gaslight me for standing up, and it's the problem what most good men face. i still try my best everyday but looks like it's not enough. i hope to see a better future in my country and I pray for this to end!",

Their movie have common story, a white girl is the actress and the hero fight with villain who looks like Pakistani and always win and than save the actress his dream girl.

      "I'm sad to hear you had such a negative experience in India - I'm also a solo female traveler in India going on 4 months being here and have loved my time. It did take me awhile to get used to some of the hecticness though. Everyone has a different experience but here are two things other female travelers could possibly keep in mind to prevent this:\n\n1) These problems are often way worse in Jaipur and other big tourist centers. But, this isn't representative of the rest of India. Go to Amritsar, Lucknow, Kolkata, and even Varanasi and some of these issues won't happen or at least not as frequently. I actually think having a guide and driver attracts most of this unwanted behavior (photos, scams, shouting, etc.) and when you're actually fully alone people tend to leave you alone more. If you're determined to go to someplace like Jaipur, I highly recommend going during the off-season for tourism (in the brutal summer heat) because it will be much calmer.\n\n2) There's a difference between being unsafe and being uncomfortable. Based on this video, I don't think there was ever an actual danger risk, even though I totally get it was scary. In my experience, no one is violent or dangerous, they are just overworked, undertrained, and trying to bring money home to their families and you are the unfortunate recipient of the results of that. Even the hotel lock story seems like a classic case of undertrained staff in hotels but I doubt anything malicious was happening. Of course, just like every major city in the world, crime happens in Indian cities, and just because nothing bad has ever happened to me doesn't mean it can't happen. However, I think its important to know that many women do have positive experiences in India and discomfort does not equal danger.",

      "My wife travelled to India solo about 15 year ago, before we got married, and in Delhi one evening she left the hotel for a quick dinner nearby. She was abducted by a group of young men, brought to an apartment and gang raped. She succeeded to escape the following evening and run almost immediately into a police officer who told her he is going to take her to the police station, but she ended up being raped once again and thrown out or his car in a dark alley near the airport. She spent a month in a hospital, before she was able to travel back home. The intervention of the embassy, police department and so on, didn't help and these young men were never brought to justice. This is a cultural and social problem specific of India, where even Indian women are in constant danger of being sexually harassed or abused. Foreign women, especially white women, are  considered morally questionable and easy. To label a whole country like this is not right perhaps, but the danger is so common and widespread that it requires from women the highest degree of vigilance at all times.",

Indian men are sadly crazy about fair skin people and foreigners basically, they festishizes them and what not. Majority of men here are s*x deprived fools, who have no social skills as to how to talk to women, they treat women like some object to be attained by whatsoever means. \n\nMy friends and I went to Goa in 2019, and I can't tell you how scared we were because a group of men surrounded us, while we were just chilling at a beach side, they were filming us, without our consent and passing comments, the worst thing was there was some guard guy there who asked us to leave and not them because apparently we were attracting them. 💀\n\nSo, I get it what you went through and this kind of harassment leaves a mark on you. People who are in anyway justifying this and abusing you deserve a special place in he*l. I hope you get better and leave this bad experience behind you. I hope India sees the day when it is developed and safe for everyone. \n\nThere are many many great men here too but sadly we are too overpopulated and the good ones are just too less. \n\nSo, all the women reading this, as a woman, I would also suggest, please don't travel here, especially if you are alone. None of the Indian girls are safe here, what makes you all think that foreigner women (whom Indian people consider exotic) would be safe. This is sad but true. I wish we could change this for the better but at present situation is just abhorrent.  \n\nSending you all the love and hugs. Please take care. 🎀❤️",

Totally Skip the popular places on Internet like Delhi, Jaipur, Varanasi, Mathura, especially the HINDU Holy Places coz these are the most crowded places where most scams happen. These places are very dirty unhygienic and have people with no civic sense, these are unnecessarily hyped-up locations. Delhi should not be more than 1 or 2 days stays and suggest travelling through Taxis booked from the hotel reception. You can travel to Himachal, or down south towards Maharashtra, Mysore, Puducherry or Kerela for a more pleasurable and safe experience. India is not safe at all for tourist though it is a beautiful diverse country, but its majority population are not good especially to a SOLO female traveler. So never travel SOLO as a female in India. Even Indians don't allow their females to travel Solo.",

Despite all this, why do people go to India for holidays to see the dirt there? Is there hunger and nakedness there? Is there a bad smell in the air there?

Make sure if you're ever going to Pakistan alone, find a nice woman in Pakistan who can stay with you where ever you go.

      "I remember quite vividly one unsettling evening in Jaipur. While my boyfriend had stepped away to fetch us something to eat, I encountered three rather unruly men. They began harassing me, persistently asking where I was staying, who I was with, and, quite absurdly, demanding selfies. They seemed intoxicated and thoroughly inappropriate. I was utterly speechless!! Frozen in disbelief, scanning for my boyfriend amidst the crowd. When I finally spotted him, he gave me a reassuring smile, a subtle gesture to remain calm as he approached with purpose.\r\n\r\nNow, do keep in mind, he’s a 6’2” boxer and wrestler, quite composed, yet no stranger to asserting boundaries. He addressed them with civility, asking them to kindly step back. However, one of them in a moment of misplaced bravado, attempted to place a hand on my shoulder. That’s when my boyfriend gently, but firmly, twisted the man’s wrist, just enough to bring him to his senses. The man apologized promptly, while the other two rather sheepishly wandered off and left him behind.\r\n\r\nWe returned to our seats, though I remained quite anxious for a time, half expecting them to reappear but thankfully, they did not. Let this serve as a gentle yet serious word of advice, always do your research, find a trusted local if necessary, and most certainly, it is highly recommended to bring someone along. Some men, regrettably, behave like ferals when left unchecked.",

Especially should project the true side of foreign women rather than just project them like having too many affairs and not staying in committed relationships which conveys a wrong idea...\n\nThird, Goa is a place known for booze and not sure whether all men will be in right sense after they drink... So better to travel there with caution...\n\nTill these things happen it is advisable to travel with company...

And after hearing stories like this—being chased, harassed, even having men try to break into your hotel room at night—why would anyone take the risk?\r\n\r\nA country with 1.4 billion people and rampant poverty, poor education, and zero respect for women’s safety isn’t some ‘misunderstood gem.’ When countless women warn you it’s dangerous, listen. Stop thinking it’s just bad luck or ‘depends on the area.’ No. It’s a pattern, and shouldn't be ignored.",

Their treatment of women, particularly foreign, is not one of them.  I wish the government would institute harsher punishments for convicted offenders.  My daughter will never travel India without me or another male companion.  Shameful behavior",

      "I felt extremely unsafe too. I decided to go solo after visiting Goa with my friend. And the taxi driver on route to the airport was very concerned about me travelling there on my own. I didn’t listen as I’m quite a confident traveller. I decided to get a train and tuk tuk from the airport to my hotel. Bad decision, I was followed, had many photos taken, and many attempts of scams. For example the tuk tuk driver took me to this busy area where there was fake police officers trying to tell me that my hotel was closed and that I needed to go to an information centre. Thank god I didn’t listen and had to get out and ran to the nearest taxi. I literally hid in my hotel for days. And then decided to get a tour guide. But yet again I was just seen as a walking wallet and taken to many shops. That being said I did have 1 driver who drove me to Agra and was absolutely lovely who didn’t ask me for any money. Therefore I gave him a large tip. The whole experience was traumatic which is such a shame because there is so much beauty in the country and the people. I would definitely say for a female to go with a group or with a man",

Sure, the country is steeped in history, rich in culture, and home to countless iconic locations—but in my opinion, the negatives often outweigh the positives.\nAnd that’s coming from someone who, as a man, could likely travel there with relative safety.

      "Dear Phoebe, Very Sad and disappointed to hear your experience in India. I was surfing through utube and your videos came up. The first video that I saw was of Mumbai and some comments in that made me see your Overall feedback video of India which you added 9 months ago. This prompted me to see the rest of your videos Delhi, Agra, Jaipur, Udaipur, and Kerala. Except Kerala, the first thing that came to my mind is that you have seriously got mugged and fooled by the travel company. The places that you stayed are seriously not recommended. Even as a Indian I wont go and stay there with my family. There are better travel companies like Thomas Cook, Kesari Travels, MakeMyTrip, RiyaTravels etc and many other good one. Iam not sure if you were running on a restricted budget, but invest in good and premium stays, guides etc. Even some of your guides seems shady. The good hotels have their own travel desks for tourists for sight seeing and they dont take tourists through sensitive areas and own full responsibilities. Iam also confused as to why police and security at these place didn't act. Ofcourse all countries have sensitive places where the tourist should be on guard. I understand that Northern India has a problem with tourism but not all places and people are like that and Yes south India is a world apart. I saw how happy you were in Kerala and your feedback was very good. The stays were very premium hence you had a good experience. Being a solo travelers could be very overwhelming, I resonate that since iam a motorcyclist and travel a lot. But it is very important to make good research before you venture and Yes India could be tricky. Things may not seem as it is in the paper, and yes what happened in Goa is terrible. I am not able to wrap my mind around as to how did you end up in such scenario and what hotel were you staying and which beach you ventured into. Goa is fully hustling and bustling with tourist and iam shocked how did you end up in such areas in Goa. I have made many tourist friends from Goa and my Goan friends run hospitality business there. Definitely theres much to be asked for from the tour company with whom you booked your tours. My insta handle is @shambhoshankara and I have started following you on Instagram. I stay in Europe now and i would be glad if iam of any help to you in your research work next time you visit India. Have a great travel experience and I wish you all great joy travelling across the world. Takecare",

      "Hey Phoebe, I'm so glad I found your channel! This video caught my attention, because I traveled almost your exact itinerary in India in 2015, except in reverse (started in Goa, then Mumbai, then Udaipur, Jaipur, Agra and finally Delhi). Listening to your experience gave me chills. I was traveling in a small group of 3 women and 1 man. It never occurred to me how different that experience might have been had I been alone. Also I should say that half the trip was for a wedding of a friend who lives there, which was incredible and her family's hospitality was above and beyond. That made a big difference for my trip, but when I am asked whether I'd go back, I'm not sure these days. Everything you've said about the relentless selling I did experience 100%. We had some great guides, but after having nearly identical experiences in two cities (being taken to soooo many vendors as part of the tour), we didn't know how to feel. I will say that Udaipur was by far my best experience too, it's a gorgeous city. But mainly I wanted to comment and say just how sorry I am that you were harassed and terrorized by men multiple times. Your story from Goa is downright terrifying. Glad you are safe. I look forward to seeing more of your travels. And thank you for putting this message out there. I think it's very important to be an informed traveler. Thank you!",
      "Have been to India twice now and totally loved the experience but would always travel with a group and use a well known tour group.

In the southern part of India, this kind of behavior may not be so blatant. If you visit Kerala or Tamil Nadu, even Karnataka—it may not be that bad.\n\nNext time, try connecting with one of your followers, chat with them, and see if they can act as your guide. If you ever plan to visit Kerala or Tamil Nadu, you can count me in.\n\nTake care! 😊",

Added forty dollars to the 80 dollar price tag. After food and drinks we paid 150 dollars to go to a beach. Sorry you had to experience that. Sounds horrifying. Makes me not want to go to India.

It may turning overwhelming and yes, some people see me as a walking wallet, but getting angry always work. I don't want to doubt about anyone's experience, but all i can say is that rather than be harassed i've been helped when in trouble. I love this country and its people, they welcome me anytime warmly and with joy. And i'll keep coming, alone or not 🇮🇳🇮🇳 ❤",

But my husband (who is Indian!) didn’t catch on as fast as I did.

I am from India and have been based in Mumbai with family for the past 14 years. It really makes me angry and disgusted to see how female travelers in India are treated. No one should have to go through this. Aside from my Mom and elder sister, I also have women in my friends' circle and it would be have been very painful for me to see any of them in this situation.\n\nHope that Mumbai was a little better for you? Seems like you had a good guide as well. It is a much safer city for women for sure but even here there are few localities where I wouldn't venture alone myself. Take care and hope that you have a supportive group of people around you.",

But this was an eye opening video so Thankyou - I’ve already been there in a group and for the most part felt safe in my group with our tour guide. But in one city Bikaner up north in Rajasthan, I went for a walk alone as needed some alone time after 6 weeks travelling in a group in India and these 6 kids around 8-10yo circled me and one of the young boys put his fingers in my private area below to feel me. I was wearing jeans but was still thrown a boy so young would do that. And also in Udaipur I was getting Indian clothes made for me as we were going for a NYE party at the palace and the guy went to measure me leg inseem length with a tape measure but his hands also touched me in my private area through my underwear. I was in shock as I was only 30yo at the time and although that sounds old I was new to travelling at that time. You’ve made me reassess my plan of weather to include India as a stop off in my round the world trip. Was planing to explore Mumbai and Goa as only previously did the north. If I do will definitely need to consider employing a local guide and driver. Thankyou for your very honest and informative reality check video!! 👏🏼 👏🏼 👏🏼",

If you are a woman, never ever be alone even for a second. It doesn't matter how old you are, or whether you are black or white or anything else. The predators don't discriminate when it comes to abuse, harassment and worse.\n\nAlways have some men near you who you feel will be there to stand with you in case you get accosted by predators. I'm sorry, I know that sounds misogynistic and patriarchal, but I'm just saying whatever occurs to me in the interests of safety. Your friends don't even have to be men of your own country, they could be men of any nationality, as long as you feel you can genuinely trust them with your safety and well-being.\n\n2. The moment you feel unsafe, immediately pull out your phone and start taking a video of the people troubling you. That alone might be enough to intimidate any would-be harassers. It may or may not be enough, but it's a start, and it's still better than nothing. This one is actually tricky because I'm fully aware that in a frightening situation this would not occur to most people, as they are too shocked and frightened to respond at all, but if you are prepared for it beforehand, it might be easier to remember in times of crisis.\n\n3. If possible, contact your country's embassy and high commission and seek help the moment something bad happens to you. It might also be a good idea to get in touch with the Indian Police, the government, the Ministry of Tourism etc. Record and document all conversations you have with local authorities, with names and designations if possible. They aren't really going to be very helpful, but again, it's still better than nothing at all, and you never know, someone might decide to step up and take action.\n\n4. Making and sharing Youtube videos like this is an excellent idea. That's one reason I'm commenting here, so that it gets a little more reach. This raises awareness about the situation and ensures that similar or worse things don't happen to other people.\n\n5. Do not, I repeat, DO NOT believe that you are overreacting or being unreasonable, or that you might have possibly done something to provoke this behaviour from other people. You are not responsible for how other people are making you feel. This is especially true of women.\n\n6. If possible, name and shame the people who have harassed you. This one is especially important. It will warn others of who exactly to avoid and what to expect in case anyone runs into these people. Don't be embarassed to take the names of people who have troubled you if you know them, name the business and companies that have caused you distress if you can, and feel free to share any photos and videos you have of these people. It would also be an excellent idea to pass on this evidence to local authorities such as the police. Again, this may or may not be of use, but who knows? It's worth trying.\n\n7. Don't let such experiences shake your confidence or self-esteem. It's normal to be upset and frightened and horrified and even traumatised, but if possible, don't let it harm your opinion of yourself and who you are.\n\nThat's all I have to say.",
      "Ah, I know it can be very overwhelming in India, especially as a female travelling. But it would be unfair to not put things in perspective before being ethnocentric. India is a beautiful country per say, but it was colonised and plundered for at least 800 years due to which it lost its wealth and majority became poor in this country. After independence our govts were incompetent in giving economic growth till at least 1991, after which we did economic reforms! And until then we had an explosive population growth. Since 1991, India is increasing its gdp every year fastest in the world and peoples' per capita incomes are rising. And as complete economic prosperity is achieved in coming 15-20 years, you'll notice India will be safe and a superpower to say the least! For now, only visit places which are less crowded and naturally pristine like Kerela, Kashmir etc., and always travel with a guide to navigate better.",

      "Dear Phoebe, during the last weeks I watches quite a few of your videos and I really enjoyed them (thank you). But this video ... there was nothing to enjoy about and I am sure you agree BUT it was an even more important video. I can only imagine how horrible you must have felt in these situations and sharing them with the world and with other women is important. As a man I am sure my experiences in India would been a bit different but even I was shocked about what you told and how those man behaved. I really liked that you not only concentrated on the bad though but also pointed out the good people (drivers and guides) you had. I sincerely hope your next travels will be all great, fun and above all safe for you again. Stay safe and keep up the good work.",
      "I am an Indian and I feel yes India is not safe place to travel without local person on ur side like many other third world countries.\nMain reason behind this is inequality in India.  Politicians have purposely kept education system broken so that people stay illiterate and poor so that they can be easily brainwashed.  Education makes imoact on manners and behaviour.  \nNo country is perfect, every country has its own issues",

I felt better in Kerela, except one evening when I stayed on the beach past sunset - that got sketchy. I have not been to Goa, but videos I've seen depict a bunch of hippies in bikinis, so I thought the culture there was a little different.",
      "It's truly moving to hear about your experiences traveling as a woman in India. Traveling alone in a foreign country can be both exhilarating and challenging, and it takes immense courage to share your honest perspective. Your voice is important, and your journey will undoubtedly help many other travelers make informed decisions.\n\nI would love to invite you to explore Pakistan as a solo traveler as well! Many solo female travelers from around the world have visited Pakistan and found it to be a place of incredible hospitality, warmth, and kindness. You'll be welcomed with open arms, and there are plenty of testimonials from other solo female travelers who have had amazing experiences here. From the breathtaking mountains of the north to the vibrant cultural hubs of Lahore and Karachi, Pakistan has so much to offer.\n\nIf you ever consider making a Solo Pakistan Series, it would be wonderful to see your journey and perspective here. Your safety and comfort are our utmost priority, and you’ll find locals who go out of their way to make you feel at home. I hope you take this as an open invitation to experience a different side of South Asia—one that might surprise and inspire you!",

      "Thank you so much for making this video. I found it very honest and extremely helpful, as I am considering a trip to India as a solo female. Everything you said resonated and is being taken to heart. That said, I will probably NOT go again. The last time I went was ten years ago and had a difficult time. Thankfully nothing that terrible happened (ie assault) but I was followed, groped, and harassed. It’s so unfortunate, because India has so much to offer culturally. I really relished the positives of that trip, but sadly, I just don’t think it’s safe for me to return solo again.",

      "India needs to educate its men about sexual harrasement. These men are cringey even when they come to the UK.

If you travel in a train, you are afraid of being looted and people try to scam and if you go to police they try to loot you and for any civil services, they expect bribe and occasional uproar  from media for rape and they die down until the next one happens. Solo women are NEVER NEVER safe in india. There is no respect for personal freedom and these tourist scammers are killing the tourism industry.",

Indian woman here living in Bangalore and have lived for 30 years in Mumbai. \nUsually women in India do not travel alone to other states and when we do , its mostly always in groups with friends or organized tours and well researched beforehand which areas we travel in those places. \nCertain unwritten rules like we do not step out post certain times (again depends on the place and never walk in secluded areas) . Also a general rule is to book good hotels with decent security. India is not a backpackers destination for a (foreign) woman. \nI wish to give you a better experience of this country if you ever feel upto it.

I've never had to threaten people with violence to just leave me alone but I definitely did there. Really too bad as the country could have so much to offer.\nIf I was a lone female traveler there is absolutely no way I would ever go there. It is beyond dangerous. The culture is genuinely toxic (not all Indian culture, just the culture around foreign travelers generally, particularly women)",

      "Unfortunately, the difference in behaviour between the North and South of India can be explained in one word... Islam. The North was invaded multiple times whereas the South stayed highly homogeneous. Therefore, the true Indian identify is in the South. You have to be a skilled traveller to navigate through the North. Even I, being a British Indian, see the clear difference when I've travelled across India.",
      "The average male experience is the complete opposite. We are mostly ignored by women. It can be lonely at times but i would not trade places with a women in most of the world. I would much rather be deprived of the opposite gender than surrounded by horny demons and running for my life. I dont mean that sarcastically, your story truly paints a terryfying picture i think most men do not understand and will never experience. Now My deepest fear is being followed by horny demons with phones. Thank you for sharing that story. I hope you truly understand the level of danger you were in. Evil exists.",

Most men and women here are so ethical and honest it is really remarkable. And intelligent.\nIn Goa, Rajasthan and Goa even as a man i didn't feel very safe. Was more tense from the dehumanising atmosphere. \nThe history in India with sexual abuse and the way India deals with partnership, arranged marriages and whom to share your bedroom and household with is painfull for everybody and causing a lot of destruction.",

And two woman who once lived in India told me to take great care and not go out at night. I traveled to the golden triangle too, the prices in Jaipur were no deals, I paid top dollar for my gifts. American woman, NEVER travel to India alone in fact, consider spending your hard earned vacation money elsewhere, Cambodia, Thailand, Philippines, Peru, Ireland, even Pakistan is better than India. The scams are bountiful the vendors are aggressive at less in Pakistan, they believe in hospitality. You’re not safe there alone.",
      "I am so sorry for your experience. I am an Indian woman and I have never been to any tourist places in north India without my husband in recent years.

I would not let my daughter go there by herself any longer despite her knowing the local vernacular and having the skin color to blend in. The place has also become extremely expensive without offering much in return. Dirtiness,  lack of manners, indifference and crudeness pervade the society. There are still some wonderful people ( mind you it has 1500 million people) but they are becoming few and far between.\n\nDon't hold back on your thoughts to be polite. You are not imagining things. It is the reality and I can confirm it as a person of Indian origin. I really wish that there is a movement that builds up that would force the apathetic government to do something to change things. It had a great culture but the current generation/governments seem to be oblivious of the dignity that they need to uphold!",

I also have done a lot of solo travels so I know what those sort of situations feel like, and I was with my sister in South India a while back and had a similar experience at a hotel with two guys trying to get into our room and my sis and I were finding things to block the door and were holding the lock so they couldn't open it.  Unfortunately they were the ones from the front desk so we did not feel like we had anyone to turn to for help there.  It was late at night so we just did what we could, and caught the first train out of that area in the  morning. Thanks for sharing your stories though. It's important to share these unfortunate truths so women can feel more safe and prepared for planning solo trips in certain areas of the world.  Also I love all your content!

All these things you mentioned happened to me and to a couple of Canadian girls I ended up travelling with that I met in Agra. They were happy to travel with me as a form of protection. They were also followed, hassled and photographed on the beaches by men as well as waking up on sleeper trains with groups of men standing around them watching them sleep!\n\nThe sex culture in India is completely warped, along with forced marriages. Men walk around holding hands because holding hands with a woman is a no go. I was also scammed and most people on the street appoching me were always just trying to scam me. I was taken to different hotels than what I asked. \n\nIndia is a love/hate relationship for me. Goa is disgusting. You are gettting harrassed 24/7. Women are 5th class citizens and the caste system is very much alive and old barbaric practices still take place. India is a culture shock, mostly because it is so backwards. Stepping over people just lying in the street begging with no limbs. There is so much wrong with this country. People go because they want to see and experience how backwards a society can get. \n\nI finished by crossing into Nepal after a crazy experience of catching our taxi driver trying to steal stuff out our bags while we were sleeping and still asking for a tip when we arrived at the border!!! Nepal was like stepping onto another planet. People are beautiful and nobody wanted to scam me!\n\nThe experience of India is something to behold (to make you realise you glad you are that you weren't born there as a 'lower caste' human and how society has allowed what happens there to go on, even as part of their traditions) but other than that, it's safe to say I would not go back.",

Ofcourse no apologies can heal the wounds of your experiences. As an apology I will pray to mother nature that you ar blessed with good health and peace.

We Indian men need to seriously reflect on ourself for the shameful act from us for harassing a tourist visitor. We have disappointed you sister  and more importantly the reputation of mother India.

Im proud of my Indian heritage and the country where my great great grandfather came from but this is so saddening for me to hear, wish you had a better experience. If I was there when that guy was harassing you for a photo I would have went for him. Now due to this video and those idiots who ruined your holiday Indians are getting a bad rep  just by seeing the comment section here there's a lot of hatred now towards India and for Indians around the world, and thats also not great. Its bad on both sides now. \nBut let me clarify I have equally heard of similar horror stories here in South Africa of girls staying by themselves in a hotel, and their rooms are accessed by hotel staff, and are raped in the middle of the night.

In Kolkata i met 0 scammers, while in Delhi, Agra , Jaipur (golden triangle route.. ) it was a disaster. Also the south of india and himalayas are a lot easier and safer to travel in terms of scammers. India can drain all your energy with all the noise and people, but it gets never boring.

But it is also true that India is not a safe country even for men because our justice system is incompetent. Most Indians are living off of crumbs and therefore they will lie, cheat, scam, rob, & do other things to people if they can earn a buck or two. Civic sense is also 0 so that's that. India is the best country for Indians and not so much for anybody else. If I was an American, I would never visit India except for Ladakh, Himachal Pradesh, Kashmir, Northeast India, & Kerala.",

The best practical advice I can give is to host an Indian or few Indians through couchsurfing or similar platforms while you are in india to meet fellow Indian travellers in a safe space and get yourself accustomed to basics . This way you can experience India in a more safer way. Also try considering south India. While north has its attractions, I see lot of westerners stick to north as its heavily marketed as the place to be. I suggest mysore, alipi, coorg, andhra, south tamilnadu etc (you will get an idea what I mean once you do basic research on these) do research here and go for yoga retreats and workaways and stay away from big cities as you will not get anything different from what you could in your countries.",

In Pakistan, men are usually raised to respect women, which might be why it feels safer. 💖✨",

      "First of all, as Indian we apologize for what you had to experience in India. It should not have happened. There is no explanation or justification of what happened with you. However India is a beautiful country with awesome people. Obviously there are some bad elements in the society but they don’t represent the entire nation. I myself have visited many countries and there are good and bad elements everywhere. I am surprised that you got chased and teased by men in public and nobody did anything about it. In all my experience living in India, people cannot misbehave with girls in public, as they would face the justice then and there. However I acknowledge we need to have provisions in place to act strictly against those bad elements who cause problems for the tourists and people in general. I am not trying to defend my country but I felt that some of the things that happened with you were very unfortunate and extreme and not very likely to happen in India. I hope and wish that you get to experience better side of Indian/Indians. I hope we eliminate some of the issues that tourists have to face in general and they feel more welcomed. India is all about spirituality, divinity, culture, respect , color, life and celebration and I really wish you experience that someday like many others. Thank you for sharing your story though. It reminds us that there are things that we need to do better as a nation and we will work on that. Our sincere apologies again.",

      "This sounds really bad . Possibly one bad experience.",
      "From your described experience, it seems your trip to India was budget-conscious, possibly stemming from a perception that the country warrants a lower-cost approach. This may have led to a backpacker-style journey, which likely influenced your overall experience. While this approach works for some, India often proves the adage true: “You pay in peanuts, you get monkeys.”\n\nYour frustrations are understandable, as India’s complexities often leave travelers divided in their impressions. Historical figures such as Winston Churchill, Richard Nixon, and Henry Kissinger have famously made critical remarks about the country—referring to Indians as “beastly people with a beastly religion” or “an aggressive lot”—and these perceptions continue to resonate today. India’s cultural contradictions, socio-economic challenges, and societal issues such as misogyny and systemic hypocrisy can indeed be overwhelming and off-putting, particularly for those unfamiliar with its intricacies.\n\nI found your narrative surprisingly restrained, as every moment of your recounting left me worried the worst was yet to come. It’s also worth noting that for many Indians, all white foreigners are often lumped together without much distinction. A Russian, Polish, German, or British white traveler might all be treated similarly, as many Indians struggle to identify cultural or national differences among Westerners. Interestingly, travelers from countries like Russia and Poland often seem more willing to tolerate India’s questionable hospitality without much complaint.\n\nYour cautionary advice to potential travelers, especially those from Western countries, is valuable. Elaborating on your experience with specific details could provide even greater insights for others, ensuring your critiques remain constructive while serving as a helpful guide for those considering a visit",

But with time this has been normalised in poor community cause majority Muslim radicalised people don't study and eventually end up living is poverty. And as people copy its environment everyone started doing it and there was no one to demotive this lusty behavior. Then in 1990s bollywood promoted criminal getting women cause of confidence.

      "It's weird there are obviously many women who look like her and are of Indian origin but somehow they figured out you are a \"foreigner\" then you kind of became an \"opportunity\" to take photo to post on their socials. Regarding scams, that happen to Indian people too and it happens according to your purchasing power judged by your \"guide\"(Not all guides who call themselves a guide are guide, some are scam artists.) on the basis of your accessories and clothing. Regarding that hotel thing, never saw anything happening midnight. But they often open your door in the morning to upsell you, asking for tea/coffee/breakfast etc. and then close back.(for each room)\nIndia is a place where the very rich and poor all would be walking in the same streets. Rich people keep themselves inaccessible to poor. Because somehow everyone feels so entitled at every exposure they want to get your money. This is probably what every poor person would do and not country specific.\nAtleast one thing she did better was having a car booked for whole trip and not using public transportation for everything. In india if you are rich you are supposed to spend on things which reduces your exposure as much as possible. Don't try to go frugal on everything, choose always expensive and big hotels, restaurants etc.\nEven an Indian, who looks more rich than medium to upper class rich will be attracting problems here and there. Try to think this holistically, you have a one drop of water and you see a water tank in front of you. You are obviously thirsty... Incentives are so high... people forget morality.(sounds strange?)\nSo, if you really want to enjoy India, go to places where only rich people go. But the point is you visit another country for it's culture, heritage and historical places. So somehow look indian, and medium class rich. Try your best to not speak because the moment someone figured out you are foreigner, you know what will happen ahead. _photo mam, one photo please..._\nBasically, try hard to mix between other Indians, stereotypical indian clothing, makeup, earrings etc. and you will not attract any problems. There are other options like booking an agency for tour and travel where all of the people create a big group to go anywhere (but there still exists the problem of taking you to scam shops etc. this again depends on agency. Some high charging agency don't do any of that cheap thing.)\n\nQuite large comment, but this all comes to me instinctively as an observing Indian.",

      "And Indians at the same time looking down at China saying their economy and country is better?",
      "I totally agree that it’s not entirely safe for solo travelers from foreign nations or even Indians themselves, but there are some basic rules of thumb you can follow to avoid more than 90% of such incidents:\n1. Avoid booking hotels below $60 per day, as these are often not properly regulated. Given the large number of budget hotels in India due to the population, these cheaper options are usually unfairly managed and more prone to incidents  (we ourselves do not choose to stay at these places). The same applies to restaurants always check reviews on Google before visiting. Aim for restaurants rated $$ or higher on Google Reviews. These options are much less likely to encounter any such issues. Best is to choose well know hotel chains : Leela, Taj, Oberoi, Marriott. For budget travels Zostels are decent as well. Book your hotels online from known websites rather than through a travel guide. \n2. It’s best, best to just ask an Indian (your neighbor even if you barely know them) in whichever country you are in to help you with the travel. As an Indian, I can say we love to share our culture, and we are just waiting for you to ask us for help with your India travels. You can even ask that colleague/friend/neighbor of yours if they know someone in the cities you’re visiting who can guide you to good places, restaurants, and experiences.\n3. Avoid booking through travel websites or tour agencies. This is one of the worst ways to travel in India, as most of these guides, as you mentioned, have commissions tied to specific hotels, restaurants, attractions or literally anywhere they take you to. \n4. Choose cities or areas within cities that are comparatively safer. For example, in my personal opinion (not to say other areas are unsafe), In Mumbai, areas from Bandra to Churchgate/Malabar Hill are the safest, and these are the areas where most of the good restaurants and places to visit are. So, you can book a hotel in any of these areas.\n5. Use Uber for cabs, a bunch of other helpful apps like Blinkit (for a 10-15 minute delivery of literally anything even a TV at your place). \n\n6. Research thoroughly before your trip. If you are traveling with a decent or above-average budget, it will likely be safer and more comfortable than traveling on a tight budget.",

We traveled like locals and visited the most dangerous places but with great caution. Rented a Cab for a week and driver clearly stated that he won't be driving after 6-7pm. My kids had the best time in India and we did miles of trekking in many places up to 15000 feet in some cases (all by ourselves and  sometimes with a local guide) and it was absolutely fabulous experience. You need to know the good places to visit in India & be careful with your hotel stay & NEVER travel alone. Yes, the cabbies might be getting some commission but they took us to exquisite and exclusive silk companies which are 400-500 years old and we saw and met local artisans making $50000 carpets and shawls. Everything genuine and nothing fake. Per my daughter, the local creams she got from  Awantipora, is better than any facial cream she gets in USA. The Almonds, Saffron and lot of other items we got from the local farms were many times better in quality than the Costco Kirkland premium nuts.

      "57-year old American male here with three daughters roughly your age.  I travel to India often so allow me to share some comments:\n\nFirst, thank you for your authenticity.  Speaking truth is key — not just because you’re being of service to others, but you’re moving on from this experience in as healthy a way as possible.  You seem brave, and that’s how you have to be when you’ve had a terrible experience like this. \n\nSecond, make no mistake.  You WERE targeted.  You were sexually harassed.  And you were in very real danger at various moments you described.  You did some things right. But if you don’t mind my saying — you also did some things quite wrong.  \n\nAs you know, India has a well-documented issue with women being treated poorly.  Catcalls all the way up to full-on sexual assault.  It’s something I hope you were well aware of before traveling there.  The fact that you responded to some of these incidents forcefully (shouting NO, etc) is important. Indian men do understand that and it “can” limit your potential for things getting worse.  Good job there.  However, there is no way — noooo way I would recommend traveling alone as a woman.  There is a very real cultural issue in India, and you experienced it first-hand.  As you said, it’s not all men.   But as you saw, it only has to be a few men to make the trip perilous for western women traveling alone.  And you dealt with a mob at one point.  Frighteningly real.\n\nThe thing about traveling to India is that you have to have the mental mindset that EVERYTHING may/must change for you at a moment’s notice.  You may get sick.  You may get hurt.  There may be environmental issues like excessive heat or monsoon rains.  You have to be ready and willing to make changes immediately, including leaving quickly.  I tell people all the time that you have to listen to your gut in India.  More than in other places.  If you’re not feeling safe — you’re very likely not safe.   You have to prepare your brain for this internal conversation BEFORE getting on the airplane.  You told yourself positive stories to keep yourself there, while your gut when sending you warning signals.  Important ones, too.  Truth is, you should have left — or radically adjusted your plan — as soon as you saw you were the lone traveler on this “tour.”   Forget about the money. That’s gone. \n\nI’m so glad you arrived back mostly unharmed (sounds like you have some mental healing to go), and that hopefully you have learned a few things about India — but also about yourself.  You’re human. You seem a very positive person.  And that worked against you here. \n\nIndia is a wonderful country filled with amazing people.   But they have their own unique issues just like every other country.  India has a \"Woman Issue.\"   You can travel India safely as a woman if you follow strict guidelines, one of which is to NEVER be alone as a western woman traveling extensively like you did.  And even though it’s not a relaxing posture, you must have your radar up all the time.  I have zero doubt that if you were with a group arranged by a reputable tour, you would have had an amazing time in this incredible place.\n\nI'm sorry this happened to you.  But you've done a good thing posting this video.",

The only word of advice that would like to give any female foreigner coming to India is to stay away from India. India doesn't deserve you. If you still want to visit the country, then travel with a male companion whom you trust. Generally sexual harassment is lesser if women are with some male companion, although it doesn't guarantee that things won't happen, because of the aforesaid reasons.",

I found the South east Asian countries in the far east to be far more safer and respectful towards women.\n\nI'm not saying all Indian men are this way but most of India is lawless and ruled by mob mentality and the attitude that everything goes.",

      "Manusmriti and Its Discriminatory Principles Against Women\nManusmriti, an ancient Hindu text, is often criticized for its regressive stance on women. It institutionalized the idea of patriarchy, placing women under the authority of male figures at all stages of life—father in childhood, husband in adulthood, and sons in old age. Women were denied independence and were considered secondary to men. The text explicitly mentions that women should not study the Vedas, thus barring them from accessing knowledge and spiritual growth. Moreover, it portrays women as inherently weak, untrustworthy, and incapable of self-governance, which led to centuries of gender inequality and suppression in traditional Hindu society.\n\nManusmriti and the Marginalization of Shudras\nManusmriti also laid down a rigid caste hierarchy that placed Shudras, the so-called lower caste, at the bottom of the social order. It denied them access to education, religious practices, and basic rights. The text imposed severe penalties on Shudras if they even attempted to learn or recite Vedic scriptures. It legitimized their subjugation and exploitation by the upper castes, particularly the Brahmins and Kshatriyas. Shudras were relegated to menial labor and excluded from participating in the societal or religious decision-making process. This systemic discrimination created deep social divisions, perpetuating inequality and oppression for generations.",

Since it's a subjective experience, I can not say how much of it was really dangerous and how much of it was the result of misinterpretation borne out of confusion, anxiety and misunderstanding the situation due to cultural differences. Most of the mass public of India aren't aware of acceptable and unacceptable behavior and asking for a photo is one such example. Most people might take offense to rejection as they feel insulted. For them anytime other than physically touching or verbally abusing should be acceptable. I think this can happen mostly in the downtrodden parts of North India.

My wife did travel around alone in these places ( Jaipur , Amritsar, Delhi, Agra Kolkata )but she stays in branded hotels ( for example ITC, Taj- expensive but safe for solo female travellers). She also only takes taxis and guides arranged by the hotel. Indian men are a highly spoiled frustrated lot and lack any kind of awareness. There are too many of them ( most of 1.4 billion indians are young)better avoid them for  good. Take the expensive group tours arranged by branded travel agents. Do not try to save money staying in cheaper hotels or planning trips with locals . Also Indian men still almost worship fair skinned females which explains them chasing for photos.

I'm so glad and so immensely grateful for people like you who make these videos and expose this sad reality. This needs to become well-known, to the point that Indian men all over the world have to hang their head in shame. It's not enough for them to say, oh it's not me, it's not me, or, oh not all men or whatever. The way Indian men behave towards women needs to start having real life consequences for ALL Indian men. Maybe that's when Indian men will take this problem seriously. As for the disgusting men who are trying to sexually harass you online, a part of me wants to say, leave their comments on here. So that they can expose themselves for the whole world to see. They are obviously retarded enough to not even realize that they are simply outing themselves for the filthy perverts that they are. But the only thing they're doing by sexually harassing you online is that they are simply providing even more evidence to support what you are sharing in this video about your own experiences. So I would say, don't delete their comments. Let the comments remain for the whole world to read.",

I don't believe there's much that can be done about it, because it pervades all levels of society. It would take massive social change and change of attitudes which will take a long time, if ever. The sad part of it is that Indian men are inherently cowards and will do this mostly as part of a pack which emboldens them to act out their repressed fantasies. \n\nLuck plays a part in how you get treated there so it's best to be prepared for it by taking measures suggested by other commenters here to try and minimise risk.

If you come with a group (preferably with some male), then these issues won't be there.\n\n1. Truth is being a tourist guide in India is something only most illiterate and unfortunate people would opt as a profession. They literally could not find any worthwhile job, and hence ended up showing you the place. So don't expect them to be always ethical, some maybe , others may not be.\n\n2. Destruction of the India has been done by foreigners for centuries. So those guides may feel \"these \"white\" people have looted us for centuries ,then can I not even extract some money to feed my family. After all they are very rich.\"\n\n3.

These places are not just breathtakingly beautiful but also home to incredibly hospitable people who are always ready to help in case of any issues.\n\nIt’s unfortunate that in India, some men tend to leer at women—not just foreign women but also local women. This behavior creates awkward and uncomfortable situations. It’s understandable how challenging these experiences can be, especially for women travelers. Foreigners often get a lot of attention in India, with people looking at them as if they’re from another planet! I feel embarrassed hearing about the unpleasant experiences some of you have had, especially with men who lack basic manners. Sadly, such behavior is not uncommon, and these individuals act this way not just with foreign tourists but with female travelers in general.\n\nI hope you continue to ignore negativity or any inappropriate messages and move on without letting such incidents haunt you.

      "The female Spanish tourist that went to India together with her husband is an influencer who bikes around 60+ countries around the world including Muslims countries like Afghanistan or the Taliban (She took a Taliban selfie?) and she experiences no harm or hostility. All the locals were hospitable to her and her husband. It was only when she made the fatal mistake of visiting the \"R\" capital of the world, |ndia (79.8% Hindu majority country), that such incidents happened. Dumka was the place where the horror happened, and it was populated by 79.06% Hindus and 8.09% Muslims (Census 2011). Try to make an educated guess what is the religion of the perpetrators and why special rights/privileges were there to protect their identities?",
      "Personally, I feel that UN should speak up more on women rights issues and create a safe list of countries which female tourists could visit. This will pressure more unsafe countries to step up measures to protect women if they value tourism money. I pity the female Spanish tourist (biker/influencer) that was beaten up, robbed and \"GR\" by 7 |ndian men in |ndia. Her husband was also beaten up and robbed. What did the |ndian government did? They found 7 masked scapegoats within hours/day and paid her $12,000 USD for her silence on this matter. 😡This is so insulting, degrading and infuriating. 😡|ndia is indeed the \"R\" capital of the world. If you're wondering why I am using \"R\" or \"GR\", reason is because |ndian moderators censor my comments.",

People who purposely tour solo and do not take any precautions despite knowing the risks are really just being irresponsible. And it's not victim blaming. Yes there are risks and flaws in the country itself but that does not mean you won't take precautions. Your security and safety is your responsibility too. It's like going into a gang territory unarmed and then blaming others when you knew  fully well what would happen to you if went there without precautions\n\nThis youtuber is smart. She went solo she knew the risks and took steps accordingly. She didn't just leave her security upto other people. If something happened to her, it would've only been India's fault.

      "Sorry you had to go through such situations. I really hope our people behave better.\n\nIndia is an incredibly diverse country with a population of over 1.4 billion people, so it's important to understand that the experiences of a few may not reflect the reality for all. For many, especially in major cities or tourist spots, foreigners—particularly Westerners—are often treated like celebrities, and the attention they receive can be overwhelming. It's not uncommon for people to approach for photos, follow them around, or act in ways that might seem intrusive.\n\nHowever, it's essential to remember that this is often more about curiosity and admiration than any malicious intent. India is extremely vast, with every region offering a unique culture, language, and way of life. Things can change drastically from one area to the next—what might be true in one city may be entirely different just a few hours away. Unlike many other countries, where lifestyles tend to be more similar across the entire nation, India is a place where the culture and pace can shift in the blink of an eye.\n\nWith such a massive population and a rich diversity of cultures, regions, and languages, it's important to acknowledge that many people in India may have limited access to education or exposure to global norms. This can sometimes result in a lack of awareness about appropriate behavior or social etiquette, particularly in regard to foreigners or women. The notion of personal space, privacy, and what is considered respectful can vary greatly depending on where you are in India.\n\nThat said, understanding India takes more than just a quick  short travel—it requires a deeper engagement with its people and customs. It's important to plan your journey carefully, make friends and acquaintances who can guide you authentically, and always take the time to understand the places you visit by speaking to real locals. India is a land of contrasts and rich diversity, and the more you connect with it on a deeper level, the more rewarding your experience will be.\n\nIndia can absolutely be safe for women, but like any place in the world, it’s important to be mindful of when, where, and how you navigate. With the right precautions, cultural awareness, and understanding, India offers a rich and rewarding experience for anyone willing to truly engage with its incredible variety and complexity.\n\nIt's all about perspective and being prepared. Just like any other country, being informed and taking the right steps can make your travels here comfortable, safe, and memorable.",

      "there’s a large cultural gap that plays a big role in how interactions between locals and Western tourists are perceived. Many Indians, especially in rural or less urbanized areas, are genuinely curious when they see Western women, not out of malice but because of limited exposure to foreigners. The fascination often leads to requests for photos or awkward interactions that may seem invasive but aren’t meant to be harmful. They just want photos to show to their friends and say, 'I met an American today''. I know it seems belittling for Indians, but actually its really their innocent nature. They see foreigners as someone exotic, alien, from a really advanced society. And Hollywood often portrays them as badass yet nice people. So when they are asking for photos, they are not trying to be harmful. But yes, Scoundrels do exist.",

I can't even ask to forgive my country for the experience you have had because it is unpardonable...\nI request other tourists who are reading my comment to not to visit my country without taking the services for some honest indian tourist guide..\nPlease come in groups and have a learned and educated guide with you before visiting indian cities...\nAgain sorry for the worst experience you had in my country...",

      "India is the WORST country for not just solo female traveler, even for a group of female travelers on their own, Rapes were so bad in that country even for local Indian females and way too much were not reported because they knew the authority themselves are corrupted. 2 big cases were reported this year (2024) from what I could recall, a young (local) female Indian doctor was raped and murdered and a couple (Caucasian husband and wife), husband was beaten and tied up while his wife was gang raped. They reported it to the police and made lots of noise and was finally compensated USD 12,000 by the Indian government. To tell you the truth, you were extremely lucky to have gotten away without a scratch and your video will certainly help female only travelers to be aware, not just to be cautious about being in India but to totally avoid going to that country.  Yes while not every Indian man is bad, the question is how many of them are not bad people and chances are the percentage is high meeting many, or too much \"uncivilized\" ones. My wife, my daughter (adult now) and myself have never given a slight thought of visiting India and will never will, even males are not safe if we just step into wrong place and wrong time. \nYour video here could help other females and I'm really thankful you have the courage to speak up, for that I have just subscribed.

However - you’re right, it is absolutely NOT safe for women. Every single time I took a solo trip in India, I got sexually assaulted.

      "India is a very tough place to travel around as tourist.  I was there for 3 months backpacking when I was about 20 with friends, on the backpacker trail.  This was in 1994 though.  The sexual harassment aspect was not well publicised at that time and my sister was also travelling around India at the same time.  I didn't hear any stories about sexual harassment from anyone at that time.  We were well prepared mentally for how tough it was going to be in terms of scams, begging and generally aggressive people trying to get money from you.  That said, it was an amazing trip.  I liked the South and the North but not so much the middle section.  \n\nThe sexual harassment seems to have gotten worse and worse over the years and it seems from your experience that India now has a well deserved reputation for being perhaps the rape capital of the world.  \n\nCan only recommend that single women do not travel there.  Even if you go with your boyfriend or male friend, that still may not save you, judging from recent reports.  \n\nSo sad that India has become like that.",
      "Please visit Pakistan instead it is still india but alot friendlier 😊",
      "As a 3rd generation Indian born in another country, Delhi, Jaipur and Agra have never been in my travel list.Those places look uninteresting and those men you see as scammers and stalking you are mostly from rurals who are working in the city. \n\nMost Indians in my circle want to travel to South India or Punjab. They would rather go to Kerala,Chennai, Mumbai, Hyderabad, or Chandigarh for shopping, pilmigrage and holiday.",
      "I have traveled India from the Himalayas to Kaniyakumari for the past 25 years. Mostly I have traveled with groups and friends, and twice by myself. I have witnessed the moral downfall coming little by little. Now is an avalanche, out of control. My worst experiences have been in Agra, Jaipur and Delhi. Mostly scammers and very aggressive men. The state I have felt the most safe is Tamil Nadu. I have never experienced any sort of inappropriate behavior from anyone. Kerala is also quite safe. My advice to young solo female travelers: NEVER visit India alone if you don't know India very well. NEVER go alone unless you stay in very safe places with people you know. When I traveled twice by myself (2014 and 2023) I stayed in ashrams and spiritual communities where I know people, I know are safe places to stay and very peaceful and loving environment. For female travelers go to India only in groups from reputed and well known travel agencies.",

They are also mostly male dominated but I never felt unsafe as a traveller. And I mostly choose a country to travel to for the nature, the culture and the hospitality… but there is something, a feeling, that puts me off to visit India. Next year I’m going to Bangladesh because I find a lot of aspects fascinating about the country and want to experience them… I told people about my trip and said it was in preparation for when I ever go to India… and they laughed and said it will probably be the same… so I’m kind of anxious about it… and wondering if I made a mistake…",

      "Hi Phoebe, So sorry to hear about your ordeal in India. I am sure you've heard of India's neighbouring country, Pakistan. Although, there are a lot of cultural similarities between India and Pakistan (as they used to be one country pre August 1947, yet Pakistan is a much more moderate and hospitable country. In fact, I will drop a link here of a Canadian solo female traveller who single-handedly travelled the length and breadth of Pakistan on a motorbike covering 11,000 kilometers. I think she travelled for an entire one year throughout Pakistan and if anything, she received nothing but support and goodwill from Pakistani men and women alike. So, if you'd like to experience scenic beauty, culture, food and heritage similar to India (without the harrasment), you should get in touch with Rosie Gabrielle - here's a link to her video:  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Dv75wGwQ2t4&t=19s&pp=ygUVR2FicmllbGxlIGluIFBha2lzdGFu   (It would be nice if you could message back whether you get in touch with Rosie Gabrielle or not - it would be good to know how you get on). I wish you safety and wellness in ALL your future endeavours and journey - Arshad Malik",

The problem is deep rooted but I'll say the Indian movie industry contributes a lot to building up such a mindset. Irony is they will themselves then lecture people against it.  Add to that a sense of deep seeded low self esteem seems to be the reason behind the selfie madness soon as they see white skin. Hopefully things change with people like you putting out their experience. Hope people with authority to induce change take notice.",
      "I am an Indian man. While I feel ashamed of Phoebe’s experience, I am not surprised. This is the reason why India, with its vast heritage, ranks very low in tourist turn out. The reason for this phenomenon, as I understand is below:\n1. Civility in public life has to be taught in schools and families. The school curriculum does not include it. Those families which do, bring up good citizen, others don’t. \n2. Poor policing and legal support. The administration never focussed on this. \n3. Poor tourist infrastructure. Even localities like Goa which do attract a fair share of tourists does not have facilities that assure to provide fine experience to tourists. \n\nFor anyone who contemplate to visit India ( not sure if anyone who watches this video would), please consider the below:\n1. Do not trust shady travel agents. Get connected to someone in India who will help you without commercial motive, say a mutual friend or his contact or someone. \n2. Let them fix up transportation for you, also a known person as guide. \n3. Avoid middle tier hotels. Go for international brands. Home stays for budget travellers only through known connections. \n4. Cities like Mumbai and Bangalore, where you can merge into the crowd will be safe. Same with tourist places which attract better quality Indian tourists.",

At the same time, India is a diverse country so there are good places and really really bad places. The usual tourist places like Delhi, Agra and Goa are the worst, these are full of scammers and sexual harassers and even as an Indian man I've never visited any of these places coz to be honest they don't even have anything good to see. South and North East India is relatively safer and offers much more in terms of fair and evolved business practices for tourists. Still, don't do it alone.

I am aware that women's safety is a relevant topic today that we keep bringing up in colleges and debates, and I guess looking at the mainstream Western woke/ anti-men media content along with news of marriage scams in India (divorce laws in particular) left me disillusioned with what women's privilege should be allowed in our society.\n\nI believe that in our country, men are also being taken advantage of laws that were established to protect them. So please provide me with some common features about the areas in which those men were chasing you. It will greatly help me understand more.\n\nWhat time frame were these incidents common at, and most importantly, if such a huge group were chasing you, was there really no person around who could help you? (Since I am guessing you would visit popular places, another tourist will visit too; if not the locals, I presume the other foreigners could at least help you out.) \n\nI wanted to bring up this question cause it baffles me that so many people would behave that way (Maybe I am ignorant or have just seen the softer side of my country).

India is a diverse country with all sorts of geography, history, culture, tradition and experiences. The country to be honest is not tourist friendly. I am from Delhi region & I am considered a foreigner in southern, western and eastern states of India, and likewise. However, proper knowledge, information, access to right places can certainly change your experience multifold. A guide, tour and travels - even I wont trust them. Knowing a person, a friend, family is always recommended. If not, travel with friends or a group. I am not ashamed of saying this but I do believe, our society is not ready for solo travellers.

In 2018, my two best friends and I traveled to Thailand. The hotel we stayed at had a large pool, and we noticed a group of Indian men, about 8 to 9 of them, who would come downstairs to swim at around 11 AM and again at 4 to 5 PM every day.\n\nWe were just three young girls, so to avoid them, on the fourth day, we deliberately went downstairs to use the pool at 8:30 AM. But, to our disbelief, just 30 minutes later, we saw these Indian men by the pool's edge (we could clearly see the pool from our room upstairs). It was a very large pool, yet they chose the entrance where we, the three girls, were, on the side, and ignored all the empty sunbeds on the opposite side. They placed their towels on the sunbeds and rocks next to our belongings, effectively surrounding us.\n\n\nThe constant feeling of being watched made us very uncomfortable, so we decided to leave the pool. As we were leaving the water and getting out, it was very obvious that every Indian man was staring at us with strange looks, as if they were trying to strip off your swimsuit with their eyes. I assure you, I'm not mistaken about my feelings!\n\n\nWhen we were changing and leaving the hotel, one of my friends forgot her phone and had to go back. About ten minutes later, she called us to say that three of those Indian men, who should have been swimming, were following her. They came out the side door after us (the side door has a secluded path, but it's the most convenient way to the street). So, we had to abandon the convenient route and go back to the main road where there were more people.\n\n\nGuess what, those Indian men didn't take the side door but followed us to the main entrance instead. After we left the hotel through the main door, we went into a shop not far away and hid for a long time before leaving. Since then, I've had no good impression of Indian men at all!\n\nYou're lucky that you didn't encounter anything worse; that in itself is a fortunate thing. I hope this won't haunt your life. Reflecting on our experience, we too feel the same sense of relief and gratitude for the luck that was with us.",

Local vendors do follow anybody for their business so no exception with you being foreigner! Let me tell you India is diverse so you can not make sweeping judgement on it, to be honest with you. No one invite you so you should not go!\n\nWe were 27 percents sharing world GDP but POMS looted us to the extent ,that we are still reeling from it. \n\nIn the next 50 years only 2 countries will be super power will be India and China. \n\nYou guys again will knock our door for your alma matter as POMS did in the 16th century.\n\nSo I honestly think you have hyped up.\n\nI humbly request you, not you only or any westerners must not travel to India even in the next 100 years even though you guys are become impecunious! \n\nGet it!\n\nDo some productive work for your self!",

This kind of behavior has become rampant in the last 10-15 years or so. This Indian men in groups needs to be policed and law enforcement needs to sort this out asap. Indian men display terrible behaviour not only in India but overseas as well and I have told by locals in South East Asia, Europe when I traveled there that they dont like Indian tourists, esp Indian men. India is such a beautiful diverse country but some parts have such terrible people. South India, North East parts of India is a lot more safer and in the north eastern states there are a lot more women in the work force, similar to South east Asia. The issue people in India do not understand is that everywhere there are men and many men, and that becomes intimidating to tourists, esp female tourists. Till the time mentality changes & toxic masculinity is removed, I am afraid there will be tourists with similar experiences. I love South East Asia - Thailand, Malaysia, Vietam, Laos.",

They feel a sense of entitlement to do anything, especially when they get some alcohol in their system. Unfortunately, you see this a lot from the less literate people who haven't been exposed to the world (not like there aren't educated predators). It's more the fascination of seeing a white person in the flesh that they've been seeing online. It's like giving a baby a new toy, so they want to explore it. I do not suggest any person travelling alone, unless you are a seasoned one and have the grit to handle the sh*t that comes your way. I'm Indian and my white wife (then girlfriend) backpacked North-South India in 2016 for over 3 months and trust me it wasn't easy navigating it, but we had the best time ever exploring this beautiful country and diverse culture. In my experience, the people in the South are more receptive and civilized than North India - just because they've had more exposure. I would strongly recommend visiting India but do take necessary precautions, good planning and would only recommend a group tour through a reputed organization, one that has a good social media following with proof and reviews.

I wont say that there are no perverts in south but way less in numbers and wont approach you in broad daylight. In my state Tamilnadu, I have seen people being beaten up when ever a woman complains about misconduct in public. People get more loud and aggressive when you move towards north. They are largely patriarchal and look down upon woman. They don't appreciate personal space. There is a way large exemption of educated, gentle people up north, but they often keep it to themselves.\n\nTouts are ever present being it north or south, so without a trusted guide or local friend, you are prone to run in to minor troubles. Bigger troubles are often when you are at wrong place at wrong time. Its pretty humiliating to see what these human cattle do to a vulnerable guest. It is a deep socioeconomic problem in India. Few states are aggressively educating its people but majority of states in north are lagging behind miserably. sigh...",

      "Dear Phoebe! I am one of those solo female travellers who just got back from India. There are rules of solo travelling a Western woman should be aware of: 1. Dress local! preferably cheap and simple to stay invisible. In some places, it's best to cover your hair too! 2. Walk around with confidence, you can smile, joke and talk to people. But do NOT touch or shake hands with anyone as this is perceived as an invite. Namaste (folded hands) is enough. 3. Crowded tourist places - avoid eye contact, be determined and assertive, don't engage. 4. Never arrive at a new place late and/or when it's dark\nHowever, I mostly experienced travelling on pilgrimages to spiritual sites, and the crowd there might be a little different. You do get selfy requests though from men, women and sometimes even the whole family! I take it easy and most of the times say yes. One has to understand, that once you set your foot in an Asian country you have to forget what Privacy is. \nI find Indian people super friendly and kind. Though yes, they can annoy the life out of you!  I am so so sorry about the experiences you had :((",

      "My wife and I do general contracting in the states and took off a winter to take our tools and find an orphanage in India and do labor on the place and love the kids. While traveling looking for the right orphanage we went on a trek to the Triund.  (Dharamsala) While trekking the road coming down off the mountain, we heard a loud group of men yelling out of their vehicle. So, I told my wife hide behind me and we luckily found a small crevasse in the rocks to shield her from view. One guy in the van got a glimpse of her and yelled,\" BLONDIE!!!\" The van slide to a stop and all these guys started jumping out. All drunk and higher than a kite. I am 6' 2\" 190 pounds and have done hard labor my whole life, barley any fat on my body. My thought was telling them we have been married for 30 years. My wife looks like she is 30. IF that didn't work, I had one option the first drunk guy reaching towards her goes 500 feet down off the cliff. It was a terrible dilemma Thank God another car came beeping their horn and they had to move their van down the hill. We exited the road went bush and luckily found our way down off the mountain. But low and behold they were waiting in the van at the end of the road. Luckily, we saw them and avoided them. The kids at the orphanage were GREAT! However, 2 months in we witnessed the smallest child have his head smashed hitting the back of his head into his food plate twice, for not eating and he was sick with the flu. We contacted the Vice Chairman at the time of the Bal Ashram Orphanage in Saliana  and he said no kids are hit there. Went over his head to the Chairman an MD and he said the same thing, went to the editor of the local paper he said he would run a front-page story, and he said I wish you would have come to me I would tell you never go there they are thefts of donated money. Well, nothing happened, no story. So got on an overnight bus and traveled to see the S.P. , like our Attorney General. He sent his man in the Chief of Police at Saliana and no one talked. The cook said all the kids had been singled out and had the heck scared out of them if they talked. A couple of years later thank God the chief of Police's daughter said they got them out of there. The Chief and his family ware great people. BTW we were thrown out of the orphanage by a group of big guys into the darkness in the middle of the night onto an unlit street. An Indian guy we met let us stay at his house and two nights later the entry doorknob was turning, and we had it locked luckily. Guns are illegal in India, and he had given me a shotgun to defend my wife. If I would have killed some guys I would of went to jail there. We are NOT going back to India two winters from now doing philanthropy in Nepal, which has a good reputation for tourists. BEWARE OF INDIA a VERY VERY SMALL PORTION OF MEN THAT WANT TO SET UP A SITUATION WHICH \"THEY BELIEVE CONDONES\" A WOMEN ALEGELY ASKING FOR A GANG RAPE AND WE WERE SOMETIMES TREATED LIKE WE WERE A WALKING ATM MACHINE! However, we met many very spiritual people there and my own spirituality is now eastern it's just a shame that a few bad apples can be so dangerous to western women especially.

They dont understand no and they think they can control a girl. That's at the root of all the problems. It's a shame cause india is a beautiful country with so many places to visit. But a solo traveller can't because of the people. The only tip is come with a group of friends. Mostly men. Avoid coming during festivals. And avoid solo travelling in the northern states. If you really wanna travel solo mumbai is the best place to be. It's the safest city in india. Ull find all kinds of people here.

Western women knew how Indian men view women...how they feel entitled to womens bodies. yet it baffles me  why they still go there..and went there alone, as if tempting fate. I have warned all my female relatives including my sister...if they booked a flight to anywhere in India, dont expect me to come to their aid if they are harassed and harmed by members of this sick society. Indian society is a broken society, lady..it doesn't matter where you go...its the same everywhere.  Even a good-looking filipino male friend of mine was harassed when he was on a working stint in Delhi...the whole experience traumatised him. All those stares and constant scams, touting..it was just too much for him...and he is from Manila!",

Also ask your guide about good hotels and also carry things which you can use for self defence in very uncontrolled situation.

This is nothing compared to what you went through ofc. I wish our guides and men in general were less horrible. I'd recommend especially to women that they chose being hosted by a nice family with responsible children that can take you to places you want to visit and make educated recommendations. Even you chose to stay in Hotels atleast have someone who is a trusty host you have a relationship with through your indian friends back in US or Europe.. There are some that hosts who also list their properties on AirBnb etc. Or stay in Expat heavy areas like Bandra",

They do harass us, even men as tourists for photographs as they make money taking photos of tourists but it is so obvious that these savages have zero respect for women’s regards, let alone a foreigner.     So many European women come to India and say it’s so great but a 4 years old girl of European origin was r-pęd earlier this month in Goa.

      "So sad this happened to you!. I'm an American woman but of Indian descent and it's been years since I've been to India.  I love the country and moreover the culture,, and as a someone who looks clearly Indian and speaks Hindi, I of course haven't had the same experience that white people or people of other cultures have had.  That being said, growing up outside of India, I was shocked especially traveling  there the last two times as an adult by how many men are on the street/public places in comparison to women.....that alone can feel disconcerting and make a woman feel unsafe.  I mainly stay with family in UP, but I would highly encourage any female traveler going alone to India to stay with family or friends or be part of part a legitimate tour group of tourists of a significant number (10-20 people at least).  I've heard Mumbai and Bangalore are pretty safe for women, but everywhere else not so much.  I was thinking of visiting my family after five years there, but after the recent Kolkata rape case, I feel on edge.....they really need to make rape and even sexual harassment punishable by castration or something, otherwise these gross men will NEVER learn their lesson.  A lot of cultures are patriarchal, but I've heard time and again that women feel most unsafe in India even compared to other countries where women don't even have full rights or the same \"freedoms.\"  I know Indians feel the country is developing and want the West to appreciate them as well as the beautiful history, culture, music, diversity of religions, etc, but the truth is NOBODY really cares....if women tourists can't even feel safe, of course people are going to just associate the country with gang rapes, sexual harrassment, and acid attacks.  Not trying to blame all Indians, but I want my country (yes, even though I'm American I do consider India my country too) to do better, so people can appreciate all the wonderful things about it.  But everyone (men, women, and even NRIs) have to put in the work and speak out about this, change behaviors at home, and for god sakes defend women when this is happening to them (unlike those dumb guards and tourists, who did nothing to help Pheobe).   Sorry, I wrote too much, but this whole mentality and patter of men (who are sexually frustrated or probably closeted homosexuals) traveling in packs to harass, grope, or even gang rape foreign and/or local women is nauseating and must stop!",

I travelled around in India quite a bit about 10-15 years ago when I was younger and I'm sure I put myself in a lot of dangerous situations without knowing it. Kerala is a relatively safer place and so is the northeastern part of India. However, even though you think you took all the precautions with a planned tour and everything, it is so horrifying to think that part of why you felt unsafe was because of the situations these tour people put you in. I'm so sorry that you had these kinds of experiences - it must be traumatising and I cannot imagine how helpless it must have made you feel. Lots of Indian men have a real problem - even though there are some very nice men too. But unfortunately you only need one bad man to ruin an entire experience - I cannot imagine how terrifying it must have been for you in Goa. India can be safe for solo women travellers, but unfortunately the more touristy areas are definitely not safe. I do not recommend it for solo female travellers unless you've travelled the country extensively before. I can imagine that this must have put you off travelling to India again. It is unfortunate, but unless India gets its act together, I can see this happening to more and more women who want to travel to India. Again, really sorry about what you had to go through",

Please avoid other states as a solo traveler , even me as an Indian travelling with my girlfriend and now wife ,we don’t feel safe in other states of India. \n\nIndia is a vast country and it’s also wrong to put a whole country into one bracket, like any other country India has tourist friendly states which I mentioned above, sadly Rajasthan , Delhi and Agra being a tourist hot spots have become heaven for scamsters and unruly people to misbehave. \n\nLot of Indians from these states will start bashing me on this comment now but honestly my father was in army and I have lived and travelled in almost all states of India so I identify myself as an Indian and don’t associate with any state or any political idiology and have also done a complete road trip with my wife in India and all these views are based on my and fellow travellers experiences.\n\nPS: India is a great country with amazing people and great places to visit , only thing lacking here is government effort in improving tourism and local peoples behaviour to treat everyone respectfully and equally..Jai Hind",

      "I'm an Indian man who has lived in the US for 41 years. US is now my home. I'm outraged that you had to go through these experiences in India. Around the middle of the video, you made a point: You had a lot of bad experiences in India, that doesn't mean that all Indians are bad. I really like that. And that's the truth. Another example: there is a lot of crime in the US but you can't say that all Americans are criminals. My family and I just returned from India after a stay of more than 6 weeks. For two days, we stayed in an upscale hotel in Delhi. When we stepped out to get breakfast and tried to hail an autorickshaw to go to our favorite restaurant, a man approached us and told us that there a was great place (Handloom of India) near our restaurant and that the autorikshaw driver would be happy to take us after our meal there without extra charge. The driver said that was correct. The man also said that there were multiple stores near Handloom where we can shop.  Excited, we agreed. We ate our breakfast and headed over to the Handloom. Alas, that was the only store there. We got in nonetheless thinking that we would look at some clothes. An hour and half later, we got out of there having spent 45,000 rupees on things that we didn't even want to buy in the first place. The autorikshaw driver was waiting patiently. He drove us back to our hotel. Right then we realized we got duped big time. The salespeople at the Handloom were aggressive and didn't take a no for an answer. My advice to non-Indians who travel to India:\n\nIf possible, don't travel alone. If you do, make sure that you don't stay in shady, cheap places. Spend at least $80 - $100 a night on hotels. Always shop at reputable stores. I don't know what to say about the harassment. Just walk away. Don't make eye contact. Indian men can be brutes. Some of them have no sense of personal space or common courtesy. But I would not lump everyone in the same box. Like you said, there are noble, decent, honorable men in India. Most Indian men are that way, in my opinion. That doesn't mean anything, though, for a tourist like you. Sorry.\n\nLastly, scammers exist everywhere. They come in different sizes and colors and styles.",

Men here  behave even worse when they see foreign women.\n\nSolo travel to India is very dangerous and especially for a woman. I'd suggest that if you decide to come here again in the future, make sure you have Indian friends whom you could trust. Only then you will experience the Indian way of life and culture. Tourist companies are not reliable and they will rip you off.\n\nThank God you made it safely out of India. Thank you for sharing your trauma.

The world is a dangerous place be it in India or be it in any other countries for that matters. Rule no 3, stick to explored paths. You are no Christopher Columbus! Rule no 4, your mentality should always be very positive and adaptable. There are some amazing videos of foreigners who are just happy and kind. They give a stern no where it's needed too.

So, I'm so hurt and disgusted that India, the home of my faith, with all those beautiful temples, and my favorite food, etc., is a place I will never get to see.

India has places where social standards of living comparable to some European countries, also has places like standards of living is that of sub Saharan Africa! (no offense to African people)\n\nUsually southern states (like Kerala) are much  more peaceful compared to their Northern counterparts. There are parts of India, where even a male can travel safely in daylight. So forget women! I am really surprised you experienced bad things in Goa. Goans are generally much peaceful, calm & quiet. Still being a touristic place, people from all other parts of India flock Goa.\n\nI know these are not excuses for the nightmare you have experienced in India.

Given the bad exp you mention regarding Goa, it seems like the tour agency was sending you to the lower middle class/non mainstream accommodations and hang out spots to save money.

It takes a lot of local experience to get a hang of this so please don't blame yourself. \n\nTraveling alone in India is not safe for Indians themselves (solo western women makes it 10-20x more scarier) if you're not able to sense out the different type of Indians you'll be encountering and the correct way to handle it. North India places also differ by city and even then, they're a total challenge if you venture into the low economic areas, which is where most of the times historical monuments are. The population density itself enabled the worst dregs to gravitate towards you while the more decent public won't be anywhere to found because they themselves are avoiding the same. It's such a big country with very high density & heavy inter-state migration, so you need to fight for you personal space in subtle ways. \n\nPlease always go for more mainstream options when it comes to traveling to India or booking an agency.   \n\nHope you give it another a chance and have a better experience next time o/",

Intentionally don't want to have physical thing than just a photo and some simple talk, but this is surely not any women what to face with some random strangers.\nAs a Indian men I suggest- never plan to travel India alone as a women, better to have a female guide who understands western culture and some interesting place to explore than just taking to some random shops to buy goods. First of all, don't just believe in website reviews (they may be fake) and plan for trip in India, even we Indian don't do such plans as well.\n\nCan watch this video where a white girls has explained all the points in brief- https://youtu.be/y2W5i_0tFg0?feature=shared",

Withouth making excuses here, i would also attribute some of your bad experiences to the lack of your understanding of the Indian society and culture. I have made similar mistakes during my travels across the US, Europe and China (once i was robbed at gun-point in the US, the only time in life i had a gun pointed at me).

But, due to increased development, social awareness campaigns, and a rise in feminism the country is improving, and I remain optimistic for the future.",
      "The behaviour of staring women openly in public completely grosses me out and I have huge respect for Indian dads raising their girl child. The selfie culture with foreigners is equally gross because for some sick individuals you are just an object and not a person which explains why these sickos can’t comprehend the meaning of NO. \n\nIt takes courage to share so thanks for sharing your harrowing experience.",
      "Sorry that you had a hard time travelling INDIA. I would suggest for any female travelling solo to not go to crowded places or even if you go, please have some companions with you. Rather visit places like Meghalaya, Sikkim, Jammu&kAshmir, Kerala, Karnataka, Himachal Pradesh. And if you wanna see how it is in metro citities, then Mumbai, Bangalore, Chennai are the safest for you.",

      "As an Indian (Man) from the southern state called Karnataka. \n\nI shall apologise on behalf of my nation for your bad experience.\nHere is my true thoughts to share about my country (Pros and Cons and tips for better experience):\n\nIndia is a great country like every other but as you shared the experience, there are dangerous areas and the thought of our people are still at a stage where it may be normal for us but for you is a threat.\n\nYes, the experience you had is unfortunately quite normal even to us Indians, though the scale of scam is definitely increased for foreigners.\n\nAnd people like to take photos with a foreigner as there is this false prestige & pride developed due to social media.\n\nWe are a developing nation and it will take a lot more time for such mindset to change. And i can assure you. Change is happening. \n\nIf you wish to travel and part of India, book through proper guide and make sure to spend money on a good tour package (India is cheap in terms of price but you will get quality as you spend more.) If traveling alone then plan ahead and plan accordingly (always be prepared for problems and take step by step action).\n\nIndia is a safe country as long as you stay in areas where we Indians stay and not venture into unsafe areas we do not go.\n\nKnow that police is not 911 and emergency no. Varies from area to area. So keep a note.\n\nFind a local Indian who you can trust online. We Indians will help always so reach out to us. \n\nThere are many Indians like me who would help you have a comfortable stay and travel in each and every town. So dont be shy to reach us.\n\nAvoid tourist trap areas. Delhi-Agra-Jaipur are beautiful places but have become tourist traps even to us Locals.\n\nHave the following mindset ⭐️⭐️(most important)\n\n1) Say “NO” STRONGLY. People will always wanna sell you and ask photos just say NO in a string voice and a few times.\n\n2) Plan and do not alter from your plans unless avoidable. \n\n3) Bargain Bargain & Bargain. Its a must needed skill (if cant find a trustworthy local to help you with.) \n\n4) Everything has a tag called MRP which is the maximum price to sell stuff. If you buy something without MRP its either not mainstream, orginal or home made. So buy stuff with MRP (clothes, accessories and everything has MRP even food.)\n\n5) Food is clean everywhere. But have medication as even we Indians get food poisoned in US/Europe or elsewhere due to change in food.\n\n\nIn summary, India is a safe country as long as you stay Strong, Plan and have a local for support.\n\n(You guys can reach out to me for more questions and suggestions. I dont care if the questions are offensive as long as you wish to learn.)",

My heart raced when you said you have to make a run for it when the pack surrounded you ( which is when the groping starts). For anyone who wanted to visit India, please please do barricade you door at night. My friend visited India after college with 2 other guys. Her door was broken into by two men and she was terrified. She cried and screamed, luckily her friends heard it and chased those two away. We suspected the hotel is fully aware and even in collusion because those two men were clearly using a key and the hotel responded and said it's just a misunderstanding.",

Women in India also feel unsafe traveling alone especially in Delhi. I would recommend only booking premium and exclusive tours and min. 4 star properties if you ever come back. Also maybe request for a female guide or travel in a group or with a male friend. \nTake care. ❤",

      "Extremely unfortunate. I have seen similar stuff happening myself(mostly with Indian girls, on one instance with a foreigner). I extended a helping hand and interfered every time I could.\n\nStaring is not considered illegal and unethical by youth over there. They don’t understand the difference between a casual glance and a continuous stare that makes a person extremely uncomfortable.\n\nAnd No, it is not legal to film somebody without consent in India. As mentioned on some irresponsible comments on this video. There are strict laws in place when it comes to intimidation and stalking somebody, specially girls. \n\nThere are good people too. Just like the driver you mentioned. There are plenty of good people. The offenders are fewer but they do exist. \n\nConsider writing a book on this. With both the positive and negative characters included in the story. The things that helped you stay safe could be taken as lessons and could be documented in the book, for helping other travelers in future.",
      "What you are telling us is not just an eye opening experience, but it also validates how backwards and unsafe India actually is. And you did not even touch upon how gross and dirty this country is, or the mind boggling corruption among the do-nothing police. \nIf anyone is making plans for vacations: do yourself a favor, NEVER EVER travel to India.\nFinally, thank you for not bowing to pressure and harassment: you're doing the right thing!",

I understand me saying sorry will not fill those dreadful memories you experienced in India, we as Indians still need to learn and grow.

      "High pressure sales is something you really have to watch out for on package tours. \n\nI found this out the hard way. I recently went on holiday to Cairo and some spots down the Nile. Like in this video, it was a package tour with flights, accommodation, transfers and activities sorted. One of my complaints before we left was that the itinerary was quite vague, often saying something like \"explore the great pyramid before doing some cultural activities in Cairo\". It turns out that \"cultural activities\" means that you will be taken to various shops and pressured into buying their products. It was really disappointing as 1) the reason we booked the package tour was to avoid these situations and 2) I thought we were going to be diving into the history and culture of Egypt. Instead it seemed to be an opportunity for our guide to have a break, while we were forced around a shop, shadowed by a salesman. These salesmen would use a lot of cheap tricks, for example if you stopped to look at something, they would put it behind the counter, \"saving it for you\", to pressure you into a purchase. They would not make the prices clear, especially for single items, often using the excuse that \"they would come up with a price for ALL the items we were going to pick out, once we had finished shopping\". And that was in proper shops. That's before we talk about the gauntlet of street salesmen that you were forced to walk through, coming into and out of attractions. \n\nI was \"lucky\" enough to experience this as part of a group tour, so at least the high pressure sales were spread over a group of people. I can only imagine what it was like as a solo traveller. Thank you Phoebe for bringing these practices to light!",
      "I had uncomfortable experiences in Mumbai as a woman. I was stalked by a guy that was massaging my hand without consent that followed me for an hour and was popping up touching me.

I want to go back for 5 months despite all this but I’d probably go with a man next time.",

Having said that your experience is scary and no amount apology is enough, but couple of advice , don’t freak out and hit them back . 9 out of 10 will not come close to you after that . For remaining 1 or 10% , trust the Indian authorities. If a foreign tourist especially girl/woman complaints it’s a direct route to jail for harassers . Always keep direct lines like from Indian phone like 112 , 100 and every state tourism website for help numbers .  Hope anyone reading this finds it helpful .",

It takes a lot of courage. You are a talented, strong and beautiful person, do not let this discourage you but let this empower you.

Unfortunately, large parts of the population don't have basic education and lack basic civic sense. Utter disregard for rules and a stinky attitude. And this behavior unfortunately casts a shadow on the millions of well-behaved, rule abiding Indians. The system is really rotten from the inside and therefore an average citizen feels powerless to make any changes in the country. Ergo i lost my idealism and just left my country 😢\n\nOnce again sorry to hear your bad experience and hope you can heal from it soon. And sorry on behalf of all the decent Indians.",

As an Indian I can tell you that indian men grow up with sense of delusion that all foreign (white) women want is s3x. It is shameless and messed up.

We are slowly trying to make changes but it’s going to be a long road to progress.

North is more patriarchal and there is a clear separation in the households especially in rural and mid tier towns between men and women. Add to this if you are of a fair complexion and a foreigner it adds to several other connotations these men have watched in internet or on tv. You will understand it if you have watched any of the sleazy dance videos in films we have. Women are mostly portrayed as an object of desire. These men grow up fantasising these skinny model women.

Because of long history of religion, Indians treat their women like dirt, how can you expect them to treat women from other part of the world well?",
      "Phoebe: We so admire your courage. We can only imagine how hard it must have been for you to create and post this video. But, honestly, we think it's one of the most important vlogs you've made. I always think that travel vlogs are created to show the highlights and best things that happen during a trip. And you've done an absolutely amazing job doing that during your career. But what we like about yours is that you also show, when it's appropriate, the \"lowlights\" of travel. After all, not everything goes perfect and, most certainly, not everything goes to plan. You aren't afraid to show that (your previous trip to Bali comes to mind, for example).  And those kind of vlogs, we think, are really important to share. Temper expectations for travelers and, most of all, be honest. And that's what you've done with your India trip. You showed the good and, once the bad got too much, you shared that as well. This \"wrap-up\" vlog, we think, was essential for your viewers.  It described what happened to you and it serves as advice to others about the possibility of the same (or worse) that can happen to them. You ventured out into the unknown and came back to share your experiences so that others can be more cautious and better educated. We may never know, but I personally think that this vlog will help others to avoid what happened to you (and maybe save someone from a far worse fate had they not taken to heart your experiences and advice). I certainly hope it does. We're really glad you took the time to make this and share what happened. Continue to courageously venture forth and share your incredible life with the world--while also being smart, cautious and safe. Love ya back, Rob&Erin\n\n(PS: Sorry for the delay in commenting--it's been a long two weeks for me--nothing bad, just work got outta hand.  Hope to do better!)",

      "I really don't recommend famle travellers travel to India alone, especially young female. It's awesome to experience different culture and see the world by our own eyes, but we must consider the possible risk, and be responsible for our own safety.❤",
      "Yeah we have some uneducated Morons in India. Sorry 😞 for those experiences.🙏",
      "Solo traveling in India indeed dangerous to forien ladies.",
      "I feel sorry for the bad experiences while you travelled in India. As an Indian and part tourism industry apologies to you 🙏🏻",
      "Best way to travel in north India like the golden triangle most foreigner visits is to have local friends , you dont need guide at all . everything you need to know is available on google about any place you visit . this type of scam happens in all major cities , even in Mumbai where I live . Never take Mumbai Darsan Bus tour its just a big scam to send you to different museums",
      "As an Indian man I can only say this to western female tourists, better go to southeast Asia. Places like Thailand are much cleaner and safer than anywhere in India. Most of India is just not worth it as a solo female traveler, especially if you're a white girl.",

      "Not save india for women",
      "Sorry you met those horrible people, never as a woman travel alone in India unless you have indian connections.",
      "It's really sad. As an Indian I would like to tell you all Indians are not like that. \nThe best way to visit India is to do some research work by yourself. Do not be dependent on anyone. You will get plenty of material on where to visit what to eat, and where to eat.what you want to buy and where you can get the best deal.Everything is available on the internet. For travelling you have a help desk in every metropolitan city. Use metro Or else you can have services of uber Or ola. These travel guides are not a recognised one. They are just there to make money or commission. So please avoid these people. In general 99%of Indians are kind hearted and always ready to help. We are full of hospitality but few people have the mentality that if a foreigner is coming here he or she must be very wealthy and rich and try to take out extra money from their pocket so that they can keep their family and friends happy.",
      "When I was in India i was told  by several people that local women squat and go to the toilet in the street because they are scared of what will happen if they go behind a bush.

      "Yea i knownill never go anywhere near india",
      "I'm sorry that happened to you.. I totally feel you about not being safe in your own hotel room. Even in outside of India, they have the same mindset. An Indian boy stole the master card from the cruise reception and tried to break into my room. Luckily I doubled locked the door. He even tried to put his hand in to try unlock the 2nd lock from the door.. He only stop after I shouted at him. Mind u I was showering at tht time. Can't imagine if I didn't double lock. \n\nAfter the cruise staff told them off, the parents didn't even apologise and gave me the dirty look even. This happened in Vietnam btw. After that incident I bought a door lock as safe guard ever since.",

      "We are really sorry about your experience in India. Even people in the comments section are so shameless that they are accusing you of getting funded by other foreign governments to defame India without actually accepting the reality. Our country is developing very fast but still, our people have this type of mindset. I really support you on this accusation as my own sister was also harassed and the majority of the people who are creating this situation belong to some dangerous rural areas of India as I know from my sister's situation. The government should organise some sessions for the people coming from these areas about how to act in the city and especially how to act respectfully towards women. You can see this type of session in countries like Denmark, Norway etc for the people belonging to the categories of refugees. It is embarrassing that we have to do this type of session for our own people. Again we are really sorry.",

During my teen age I visited north India in train despite I am a boy a man touched my private parts during the travel. I got scared at that time i was just a small boy. From that day I never go to north India alone. I got traumatised by it. Sorry to hear this happened to you.",

It was not ur ebility that u were born bettr part of the world. Otherwise it would have been at the other way around. Just give them knowingly if u have. If u dont have, let me know.

But later many guys tried coming one after another clicking selfie with that female foreigner. And these guys were not clicking any picture with that guy. They wanted to click only with that lady. And the way those guys were touching that lady while taking selfies and photos. Damn... that was disgusting. I feeled ashamed as an indian. And to the surprise i was expecting them to speak up. And i wanted that man to protect her wife. But... \nAnd i have seen similar kind of clips specially during Holi festival. \nThey see this as a chance to molest and harrass foreigners.",

      "Thats 100% true... Solo Woman travelling in India would become the worst experience. \n\nI would not allow my sister to go out for a solo trip. Some man (relatives, brother etc) has to always accompany her for her safety. \n\nMostly in India, the locality is populated by certain caste people and thwy live closeby. Each locality differs.\n\nHowever a foreigner (that too a white) travelling to India would turn into worst experience. So before you come, there should be a host ( like a family whom you know) from India to host you in India. \n\nAgain, you should know them deeply. \n\nDont go to India if you dont have a host.",
      "Phoebe, you could sue, if you can or atleast strongly legal action. \n\nIm a woman from India. I spent many years outside the country and returned to India during the pandemic and was locked down there. \n\nWhat you described about cards not working and leaving hotel room doors unlocked etc is bang on. Female staff in the hostel I stayed in Jaipur walked in on me using the universal key card. Once I did leave the country I couldnt trust for a long time that noone would enter my apartment. \n\nMy family had a family gathering in a star hotel in Bangalore, and the hotel driver who drove me to the airport asked me if my father was a customer of mine and if i was using the cover of \"father\". We threatened to sue. The star hotel checked our passports and found we were indeed father and daughter and apologized - but it was horrific for us. The front desk staff at the hotel sobbed when she heard me sobbing.\nI had a panic attack on the airplane and asked to remove covid masks and was moved inside the airplane and the airhostesses teared up.\n\nThe system is systemically exploitative and extractive. \n\nI had a travel insurance provider who was selling me travel insurance inform me there was no cover for sexually transmitted diseases after asking me if i traveled alone. He had to find a way to patronize me while selling me a product. \n\nI was asked to cook by a hotel owner and to serve him water during the peak of the pandemic. I was trapped with them and they took the opportunity to humble me. \nI was paying full price at his hotel where he had no other guests because of the pandemic. Im a woman with a very respectable financial standing and this was very jarring experience. Since they controlled food during the pandemic if i didnt pander to their expectations, they would not give me food. I remember being willing to tip people generously just to stop hassling me. I had to pay the price for being a woman that had a level of financial affluence without paying the toll for violating their social norms. \n\nThe government official who administered my vaccine misbehaved with me. I could do nothing without having an instance of SH and it affected me to my very core. There's this dull feeling of resignation when the body goes into survival mode when this happens over and over.\n\nI had a landlord in one of those apartments who was my protector. He made some passes, but very respectfully and told me as I left that I should never return without a male figure. I thanked him because he had looked out for me. \n\nIt was an 8 month long nightmare. My family had left the country but I had an Indian passport and couldnt leave with much ease. I also lost emotional strength and faculties during that stressful phase. \n\nYou made an effort not to hurt people's sentiments while being in excruciating pain yourself. I appreciate it but that takes a heavy emotional toll. Truth is, that is a culture which coddles its men. There should be economic consequences, these are natural consequences.\n\nI eventually purchased a Privilege visa and guaranteed that I would always have another option I could reliably fall back on if there were yet another unforeseen crisis. \nI remember thinking to myself, well death is inevitable but id like to age and pass in a society where I do not feel such an intense alienation towards, not to mention feeling hunted, intruded upon and watched. It has definitely impacted how I relate with men, both from my culture and others.\n\nIn Himachal Pradesh, they would matter of fact open my Amazon packages and refuse to pick up my garbage. \n\nWhat you said about the sense of relief when you left resonated. I had to sleep for four months and could hardly work, so I requested time off and my clients understood. It took me 14 months to stop being worried that someone would enter my apartment in the next country I now live in. When i shared my concerns in this new country, people are simply amazed that I would even have such a concern. \n\nIve been reflecting on my sense of identity, belonging and self worth as it pertains to the country I was born in. \nI question if unconditional loyalty is owed to any system one may belong to where one had no choice. I will change my passport for cathartic reasons. I also plan to lobby for extending refugee visas for Indian minority women so more women who want to live peaceful lives outside can have options availavle to them.\n\nIt is an incredible country with a powerful past but I should not have to carry such a heavy weight to accommodate a society I find harder and harder to understand. That the burden should be on you, or on me to communicate effectively while being traumatized and violated is a tad bit excessive.",

I wouldnt go again as a solo female traveler like I did before but hopefully with someone else, a male. I personally wouldnt recommend female solo traveling to india or the middle east.",

I am from India but this i never understood. but i know one thing, many people who wants pics or stare at you are not harmful but just curious.

      "As an Indian, I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart for making this video. As someone who comes from the Himalayan part of India, which is much more civilized and peaceful than any part of mainland India, I find it extremely suffocating to travel to places like Delhi. Not only are the people extremely dishonest, but the place is equally disgusting and filthy. You can't trust anyone here. Even the people you've paid will be dishonest and always want more money. A woman from the US was scammed in Jaipur for fake jewelry, and when she came back, they refused to even recognize her. The same filth is being imposed on the good parts of India, like mine. At least you have the option to leave, but unfortunately, I'm not so lucky. Most foreign YouTubers who come to India try to paint a very false and rosy picture of this hellhole just for views and subscribers, misleading people in many ways. Don't focus on negative comments.

      "Phoebe so sorry to hear about this. I am an Indian man and it hurts me to hear that women are being treated like this.\n\nA tip to solo women travelling to India:\n\nIt is better to avoid the locations which are famous with local tourists, Jaipur, Agra, Goa. These cities are very very famous with locals. Now these local tourists might be travelling for the first time in their life. They might have never seen any foreigners and they might find you fascinating and would want to click pictures with you. \n\nTo avoid this situation, go to tourist hubs which gets the civilised crowd, the crowd which is well travelled.\n\n\nOffbeat locations are much better for tourists, because they get the civilised Indian crowd. So instead of Goa maybe you can go to Gokarna, instead of Jaipur you can go to Udaipur or Jodhpur, instead of Haridwar go to Rishikesh. The lesser the number of local tourists the better the experience is going to be.\n\nIf you do visit local tourist hub. Try to find areas which are famous with foreigners and stay there. You can ask on any forum. In Goa you have Arambol famous with foreigners.\n\nAgain as an Indian man I am sorry for this experience. This fetish of locals for foreign women should be penalised. It is killing it for our guests. The government should run ad campaigns and make the locals understand how it feels to shove cameras into tourists’ faces.",

      "Hey Phoebe, sorry to hear about your experience in India. As an Indian that grew up in the US, I would make some suggestions. \n\nIs traveling solo as a female safe in India? Yes & No. You have to do it the right way. Spend the extra money and stay in a proper five star hotel, Oberoi, Taj, Leela, ITC etc. Then book a proper guide through the hotel that they regularly use, not some local. This way, you can tell the guide exactly what you want and what you want to avoid, and they will follow your instructions to the letter. \n\nLast thing, In India, you have to be rude to a certain extent. You have to keep blinders on and keep walking, pretend you didn’t hear anything when someone asks you a question. Dont slow down for anyone no matter how nice they seem. Hope this helps. Ive added you on insta, feel free to message if you have any other questions. 😃",
      "As an Indian, it deeply saddens me that your visit to my country was marred by such negative incidents. I want to extend my sincerest apologies for the harassment and discomfort you endured. I am so sad and angry right now. I hope this experience does not deter you from exploring other parts of the world.",
      "I am from India. Stumbled upon your channel while searching for videos on an Australian road trip. \n\nWatched your Cairns video, wanted to see more of the places you’ve  explored in Australia… the first video on your channel was your India experience and as soon as I saw that I knew what to expect. \n\nYour experience was far more horrifying than I expected it to be. \n\nFeeling really ashamed. I can do nothing more than apologise to you. I’m shocked and saddened.",
      "I feel uncomfortable listening to this. This is crazy sad.",
      "Hello Pheobe.. maximum people in the tourist industry who are guides and sellers of dainty stuff/mememtos are more like this, chasers/stalkers etc.. they treat women, especially foriegn women with fair skin as things, objects, not as a person. In most places in india, do not go out after dusk unless you have truatworthy company. Probably Pune and Mumbai are the only places where you can roam about safely in the dark hours. Delhi is known to be not safe for women after 7 pm. Couchsurfing groups in these citiea will probably help you get company for exploring the night life. Preferably go for a female who looks and feels safe in couchsurfing(cs).\nBut still be safe and avoid lonely places with a bad vibe everywhere, be it mumbai, delhi, pune, newyork, london etc, irrespective the city/country. Its always better to be safe and on the safer side. Also always get to a local police station, have the police helpline number handy so that you can call them in India. You can also approach your embassy in that city, if the city you are visiting is famous for tourist attractions. The police/embassy will guide/help in some way.",
      "So so so relieved that you are safe now, that was so scary to hear about. Im sorry it is still ongoing. Please reach out to those who can support you. You arent being dramatic, your feelings are so so valid. Xx",
      "This is so sad to see as an Indian. I am from Northeast India and even we have to be very careful in places like Delhi. So many fraud people are there. But Mumbai is always good. Glad you made it safe.",
      "Same thing happened to you and Travellight blogger in India",
      "You are wise to highlight the dangers unfortunately parts of the world are not ideal even today for solo female travellers notably parts of the Middle East, Africa and South America, stay safe.❤",
      "As a keralite I am So happy to hear your good comments about Kerala tour (Gods Own country), same time so bizarre to listen worst experience you faced from other parts of India, You were lucky enough to escape from all those harassments. So dangerous place for solo female travelers especially North side of Indian.",
      "Kudos to you for sharing this! It takes a lot of courage to speak up and out.\nThis is the sad truth about India still. It is a beautiful country marred with men like these you met in your journey who just completely destroy the experience. \nFirstly, it is good to see you safe and sound. If you plan India, always and always travel with a local friend from India. Let them guide you and be with you during your journey. Just do not trust anything on its face value in India. I being born and brought up in India still am careful when I visit India with my family. Even I urge my non Indian men friends not to travel alone.\nYou still are ok in the big cities like Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, BEngaluru etc for most of the parts, however if you are venturing anywhere else always go with someone you know and trust.",
      "Really sorry for your bad experience. As a tourist if you are not open and are conservative India can be a hard place to travel. Some Indians don't understand the limit to make others uncomfortable. I know it will defeat the purpose, but when you come to India and contact locals in all the cities you want to travel to, you will find people who would love to show you around without charging or scamming you.",
      "As an Indian i accept A solo white girl travelling in India is definitely like a hell you should have just visited the bottom ( South India) & top of India ( ladakh, Srinagar, Himachal) & north east. the place you went are the most crowded areas even filled with millions of illegal immigrants from Bangladesh Myanmar Pakistan but still how no one came to save you usually lot's of guys are there who can pull you out from the crowd make you feel safe",
      "Going to puskar Rajasthan",
      "Wow I watched your video because I got a couple comments on mine saying you had a bad experience and asking if mine was similar. While guys in India, and traveling in India in general, can be intense, it sounds like you had really bad luck! I solo traveled all over India for 3 months (booked my own trains, buses, hotels/hostels) and I didn't really have any issues. I also met lots of other girls who solo traveled India and loved it! Also whenever I had guys be annoying, other random guys on the street would get them to leave me alone. \nSo yes - India is intense, but not every solo female traveler has a bad experience there. I'll definitely return to India again (even solo) to explore more places. And hopefully if you go back you'll have a better experience! ❤",
      "I just hope travelers from other countries just stop coming to India, just so that the grand false image we have of ourselves is shattered. There are no bad apples here, whole Indian society as a whole has accepted its ok to watch a lady being harassed in public. Its rotten. I just hope you recover well from this.",
      "So sorry to hear that you had to go through such an experience in India. As an Indian, I feel so sad and angry the way tourists are being treated.",
      "i'm really sorry that happened to you",
      "😭😭😭",
      "Some intent people are literally trying to cheat foreigner. Really shameless for me being an Indian. Otherwise i have met lots of foreigners there they asked me for finding the train and routes. I have never ask anything more other they want.  I am currently in Poland.",
      "this is heart breaking.",
      "Why you people have to travel around Delhi- Jaipur- Agra- Udaipur. There are numerous places in South India which are absolutely safe. Delhi & North India is somewhat unsafe.",

It makes me think about which one is the real experience or may be both are real. What you experienced is really bad and no one should experience something like that. \nBut at the same time those fellow Indians feeling ashamed, you shouldn't be. Its not your fault, it's the fault of that individual who did that shameful thing, stop asking for forgiveness it's not your fault. Karma will get to that Sh*t person one day.",
      "Thanks for speaking out.",
      "indian man here and i am just ashamed how bad our country is for solo travellers like you sorry from our side we are a developing nation but i am optimistic we will reach a good level one day thank you so much for coming out and narrating your experience a lot of introspection is needed",

      "Indian male here. Going to be brutally honest.I am not surprised by your comments. There is a big difference between Northa and South India. It is dangerous to travel alone as a foreigner female. Most Indian men are sexually \"starved\" and dangerously attracted to white women. People have never seen a white woman in these regions. Staring is a normal thing. If you were an ugly person, may be you won't be hit at this bad . :-)",
      "What a nightmare holiday .",
      "After the Spanish couple incident, it should have been common knowledge that India shouldn't be considered as a tourist destination. No amount of reforms would eliminate such \"men\" who stalk & stare like creeps, and some even go the distance to do the unthinkable. Police won't help you, nor would the local administration. Better be safe than sorry.\n\nTry visiting Japan, South Korea or Singapore instead.",

What you did endure is UNACCEPTABLE, those \"men\" are vile monsters. It must have been so scary for you. I'm a huge fan of you and your adventures, as well as a father to two young girls, watching you tell this tale I was torn between empathy, anger and wishing that I could have been there (if just passing by) to protect you. How dare they! I hope that you NEVER experience anything like that ever again. You are strong, you are amazing, you are brave. I hope you can continue to make your wonderful videos and that you will forever stay safe.",

India can be a little unsafe and since the population is this much there are all sorts of people here.. I am so sorry you had this experience.. and I hope you are feeling better now.. and to people who are planning to travel to India solo or in group I would suggest that try and find good reputable companies as your tour agents or plan your own itinerary in advance .. this is what I do when I travel India or anywhere across world..",

      "Hi Phoebe, I'm from Kerala, India and sorry to hear about your bad experience in India. I don't want to sound patronizing like others, as I think you would have figured many stuff by now on your own in the hind sight. But I sincerely request you to please upload a separate video with all the prepetrators of your bad experience in India. Including the tour group, videos or pictures of people who have harrassed you. I know, you may sometimes recieve cyber bullying for this from the ignorent Indians, but educated ones who understands the gravity of the situation will support you. Indian government itself is trying to improve their external brand and hence I m sure will take action on this. Please do tag the police departments of the respective states. Finally, i sincerely hope this wouldn't be the last impression of you about India. I remember your lovely memories of Kerala, even though you were with a group. Please do give a second chance, this time visiting Kerala again, Hampi, Bangalore, the northeast India etc. Please do your due diligence and stay with the best rated hosts in Airbnb and travel with local guides (Like Anand or Singh) and avoid the big tour agencies. Hopping for a better and safer travel next time. Good luck. Take care.",

      "I’m so sorry to hear about your experiences 😢💕 Thank you for shedding light on all of this so woman can make an informed decision around their travel plans. I will never travel here, this type of behaviour is not only unacceptable but disgusting. Sending you big hugs and positive vibes 🙏❤️",

      "Hi there Phoebe - Sorry for the really poor treatment you received at the hands of these really nasty people in my homeland. You need to share more details about these really bad tour companies, the hotel details and the various cab and tour guides you had. In today’s world of social media these guys who are trying to make money off harassment should be punished where it hurts most - economically. Share and shame these folks on social media immediately. Raise your concern with women groups in India. If you need connections I am happy to share them with you. However, I would highly recommend fighting back hard. These men were bullies and bullies only respond to pushback. I too have a daughter who I hope would want to visit India on her own someday, but your story puts that in doubt. So please, share more details and fight back for your sanity and for the sake of so many others like Anand in Mumbai who are just doing their job as professionally as possible. Sadly, guy like him also suffer as they get bracketed into the same group.",

      "Hi Phoebe, I am really sorry to hear about this. I have been to 27 of the 28 States of India and to all the 8 UTs. I know it is a difficult country to travel to for a solo female traveler coming from abroad..would be best to go in groups or with people who know the place well. It is always recommended to book in 4-5 star hotels while travelling in India (I know you may miss a bit on the local flavor etc) but safety wise etc is much better.  I have traveled to many locations even with my young daughter alone, and avoided such experiences such as the person trying to get into your hotel room in Goa that you talked of. You should have picked locations like Ladakh, Sikkim and Meghalaya first for your experiences as a solo traveller...and could have done the popular destinations like Rajasthan, Goa through a good travel agency in India or people that you personally know...........if you ever travel to India again, would be happy to recommend",
      "I’m so devastated to hear what terrible things happened to you. You are absolutely doing the right thing by sharing your honest experiences about how everyday tourist situations, in broad daylight didn’t prevent the harassment. As someone who has been wondering about doing a solo female trip to India I sincerely appreciate your insight. Thank you for your honesty and I hope that these disgusting trolls stop harassing you.",
      "When I first saw your video that you traveled to India alone, I felt scared for you. My family and I travel a lot, but India was never and will never be a part of our list. I've heard and seen a lot of negative experiences from foreigners traveling there, some of them experienced something a lot worse than what you went through. And I'm sure not everyone there are that disgusting, but it's not worth the risk. I'm glad that you're okay. And spreading this video should help and warn other people to just skip India because there are a lot of other places out there that are much safer to visit. And yes, this isn't even my personal account because I know those people are most likely going to spam mine. if anyone wants to visit India, especially alone, no --- just NO!",

The total lack of basic security even at allegedly good hotels. I wouldn’t consider it safe for solo travel male or female and I’ve done some pretty remote travel in all continents. I did India in a large group in a package tour and the harassment was still constant. It was fun with interspersed with big periods of just irritation with the place. Most of the women in our group got inappropriately touched or sexually harassed by the men there. I’ll say it again, India is a shitshow and I’m sorry you had to experience this.",

      "@travelforphoebe I feel really ashamed for what you had to go through in India! Unfortunately, such desperate, mindless & unethical behaviours are an overall exhibition of a lot of factors starting from showing white girls(Westerners) as background item dancers in our domestic film industries, to porn & Russian escorts business. The parts you travelled(North India) are anyway not safe for any female, forget foreigners. \n\nOne piece of suggestion: Now a days, you have social media. Why don't you try to make some genuine contacts in India? I think that's profitable for you from all ends! Get going with young Indians who are easy mixing & aware about the western world & cultures, they will not only help you find safe places & passes, but such contacts will also help avoid unnecessary expenses & explore India without this harassment! An insta friend of mine, a girl(German) is suppose to visit India in 2024. She is making her own arrangements but has confirmed to stay in touch. I think that's the most prudent thing to do!\n\nAlso, if you ever come to Kolkata(East India), you might find the people different. As I live here, I can say with certainty, people have a sense of self respect & maturity that prevents from such hankering & desperate behaviours!",

      "Goa was a beautiful state with amazingly clean, untouched and pretty beaches, nature and people not long time ago but because of over tourism, prostitution, gambling and drugs it has attracted the predatory and wrong kind of people who only have one thing in mind. In their fucked up mind, they think every white or foreign looking women is open minded in spending intimate time with men and this just kills the soul of the place. The actual Goan locals are sweet and also hate this kind of behavior plaguing their territory because of these predatory misbehaving and rash men who are also delusional and childish and do not know an A-Z on how to approaching and talking to people alone without intimidating, forget women alone. They uneducated, ugly, and misbehaving freaks who break rules and do anything for fun (also called 'Chapris' in India and famously shitted on by normal people of the country). Though i have heard 3 or 4 people wanting to take pictures of foreigners with them but It is hard to believe there were 40+ people running after you and that is insane and also rare here for foreigners alone. I think you struck bad luck with these bloody strays because its unheard of to think cases like that even for foreigners in India especially in Goa ever happening. I am sorry for your experience and as an Indian covering up my shame, I suggest not to travel to this country because if I were you I would not spend my time and money going to a place destroying my vibes and peace. And even if you decide to come back avoid Delhi, Most of north indian cities where men are very suspicious and sexualizing in their behaviors and Goa as well. South Indian cities like Bangalore, Hyderabad, Chennai and West Indian cities like Mumbai, Kochi would probably be much more open minded and filled with normal people. The North has a very traditional and rule-breaking mentality compared to South which is also why over the years South India is much richer than the North and has attracted more foreign and local developments than north and is filled with lesser scammers and beggars. Stay safe and happy....!",

I apologise..and have been seeing your videos and loved your video and experience of UDAIPUR.

      "@travelforphoebe Hai Love, I am really sorry about things which you had to go through. I would like to shed some light and give some pointers to other solo travellers. \n\nSee India is a beautiful place, the tradition, the customs etc but travellers have to understand that this is a country which is still recovering from the shackles of independence, People didn't had much experience to see outside world, for them you are standing out like a Alien or a Deer in headlight. \n\nIf you are vary of people or are a introvert India is not for you. There arw 140 billion people living there.\n\nNow what happens is Most of tourist fall for the Golden triangle trap, they land in Delhi (worst city safety wise even for locals) then there are scammers on every street there because everyone is hustling. Try to spend minimum time there, there is nothing to see much in Delhi. \n\nThen they go to other tourist trap of Jaipur etc where most of population is not literate. Men and women both are struggling to make ends meet, they have not seen outside world much, so when girls come and visit they get curious. \n\nNow the mentality of those 95 percent men is not to harm you but to take picture with you to show to their friends or family that they have taken a picture with a white person, it doesn't matter if you are a white male or female they will take pictures with both. \n\nIf you are not comfortable you have to be assertive, it is always advisable to visit some posh places or make some friends prior to visiting india as india is not for beginners. \n\nNow the most important mistake people do is they just read about these places and go and ignore the best places which they ahould have went like Leh Ladakh, Himachal, Northeast Assam, sikkim, Shimla, j&k, Kerala. The people you will find in these places are more friendly and well accustomed. \n\nYou ahould always book a reputed company for tours and travels, something high end, they take care of all your safety and experience. \n\nTraveling in india is a experience and it can be Bad or good depending upon how we make it. \n\nIt is always advisable if you are visiting India be prepared to be looked upon, people will approach you out of curiosity, many times 95 percent as I mention they would like to click pictures, aomw might even enjoy the attention and some will not. \n\nYou have to be assertive and maintain distance, always keep a driver accompanied with you if you are alone. \n\nEven indian people from other cities face same problem, always vary of scams and those trying to take you to shops to buy things. There is a fixed percentage of sales tied. Hence try to avoid such guides and book guides from online well reputed company, they will take care of you. \n\nI am again sorry for things you had to go through and hope you dont think bad of all Indians and possibly will come back and see other side of india.\n\nIndia itself is a experience, you just have to find it, as a solo girl traveller it is hard to travel but have to pick the right experience. Avoid scam places. \n\nGoa is also now full of foreigners, many practically living there, people are SA there but the police is equally stringent there, you can just file a complain and they take care of things. Catcalling and stuff can happen visiting many places even in West, happens to my friends travelling in London. So no place is safer for solo women travellers, you just have to take self precautions and rely more on your inner instincts. \n\nI would suggest people who are looking to travel to india is look beyond the tourist trap, go for places mentioned above in my comment and see the difference. \n\nAlso those places are natural and clean and serene. Hope it helps clear few things. 😊\n\nIf anyone has any questions or need help please write ✍️ below and I will try to guide properly.",
      "去之前在youtubu搜一下印度旅行 就知道 那地方对女性很不安全😢",
      "India is not safe for female",
      "Did you have a video of these experiences, as there is a law in India called Eve Teasing that could be passed to the police? This is a serious offense in India. As a vlogger, that would have been the first thing anyone would have done with their phone, especially if someone was trying to get into your room. Proof can be essential for any prosecution. As an Indian, I am very sorry this happened to you and would want these criminals sent to prison. Additionally, you should have seen a red flag when you were the only one on the tour with the guide. Always use government-approved guides never use someone cheap, or inexpensive hotels. Use TripAdvisor or other review sites, before booking anything. Oh, by the way, this happens worldwide with people with no knowledge of areas and people in certain locations. I have seen this in Central London happening to tourists all the time. This is where I live by the way and own a Taxi company. Seen and heard it all from tourist's experiences..",
      "I just can't wrap my head around it: Why was taking photos so important to them?",
      "We went to India last March,  as always we joined a reputable American tour company and we had a fantastic time there. Our group had 32 tourists two guides and a driver. No harassment what so ever. Live and learn 😢",
      "Glad you are OK.  Absolutely disgusting what you went through.",
      "The harassments were done by local young men hanging out alone or in groups, right?\nHave you ever thought why they seemed to have nothing to do? Well, in case you're not aware of yet, millions and millions of young men are jobless - in fact many of them have been jobless even for years. Unemployment and underemployment in India is still one of the worst in the world according to the International Labour Organization (ILO) 2024 Report.\nWhen so many young men are jobless and got nothing to do, they hang out on the streets, and some .... wait for prey. Right?",
      "Thank you so much for pushing past the feelings of discomfort to share your real experience with us. It's really important to hear. And I'm so sorry that you had that experience. It really sounded terrifying.",
      "I don't know what is good to travel to India. Is India clean? Big no no. Is India safe? Big no no. Is Indian food good? Big no no. Please visit China, now China provides 144 hours of free visa for foreigners, keep your mind open, and go to China to have a look yourself, and then you can compare India to China which one is better.",
      "I'm saddened to hear that you had an bad journey. I recommend visiting mainland China, where you can find modern cities, beautiful natural landscapes, and rich cultural heritage. Most importantly, the people there are very simple and friendly.",
      "India is not safe for solo women traveling",
      "Just tell them I will call the police, mostly they run away",
      "My female friends all have at least one story, which is tough for me to hear since I've had such positive experiences. Thanks for sharing as I've had women ask me and I'm not sure what to say sometimes",
      "It’s unfortunate these things happened with you. The fact that you were the only traveller in your group should have been a red flag from the beginning. Usually well known tour groups who have good ratings are filled up and are preferable to go along with. You need to name and shame this tour operator, because definitely they did not have any concept of providing you a good service and only setup to fleece customers. Other travellers need to know so they can avoid and report accordingly to the authorities. Also, a well known tip, try to avoid the golden triangle areas which are famous for scams and chaos. Unfortunately it is because of these areas the many other vast beautiful regions and culture of India are over shadowed and less known to the outside world and gives the country a bad name and is pretty much generalised and stereotyped as a not so safe destination.",
      "❤ love from tamil nadu 🤩 India 🇮🇳 ❤️ 🪷",
      "Geez Louise India sounds scary. I love seeing you taking us along on your solo adventures & I love that you are doing it all alone ( some of the places you go potentially give me encouragement that maybe I could do  them solo myself). I do love that you have included this vlog & that some of your India vlogs you gave us a taste of your authentic thoughts but I didn’t realise it was as bad as that !!!! OMG your hotel room ( if you can’t be safe in your hotel now that makes it dangerous). I can imagine how you felt and it’s bad you had to experience that but thanks for sharing ! Hmmm I won’t be going to India",
      "Good you made this video to make people aware of the reality of my country rather than stupid vloggers just showing good parts to acquire indian audience",
      "Thank you for sharing so honestly. I had been seriously thinking of a trip there in a few years time (not solo) but it’s really put me off hearing your experience. Not to worry, there are so many other places in the world to explore - life’s too short to have a horrible or terrifying experience. So sorry that you had to go through that - on the bright side it will make you appreciate your enjoyable travel that much more!",
      "As an Indian iam ashamed.. \nIndia is Really not Safe for Tourists and also Same goes for Local Women's.. \nIndia is Really Lacks in Women Safety...... \nPlease don't Ever come and Visit..",
      "North India is beyond help, glad you’re safe ❤",
      "Hi Phoebe, I am from Bombay and am so sorry to hear about these terrible experiences you had in India. Horrible. I Understand North India is tough, but now hearing about your Goa story really sounds terribly bad. Never thought this would happen in Goa.",
      "Even Delhi is not safe for Indian's also.....",
      "It's very sad....that you faced such things in your India visit.....you must talk to some Indian vloggers before visiting India.",
      "Maybe try another old Asia country next time.",
      "Thank you for being brave an posting this video. 🙌",
      "Omg that is such a scary hoilday. Be kind to yourself. Not fun feeling powerless and alone. Maybe a big set up right from the beginning. That you were by yourself from the start.",
      "Hello Phoebe……Greetings! I am an Indian leaving on a beautiful Island called Mauritius. First allow me to apologies on behalf of my country for what happened with you in North India and in Goa, it’s really sad that these kind of men still do exist!🙏 However not rubbing in the negative part too much, I would like to tell you that (if at all) you happen to visit Mumbai again then please do visit the ISKON temple in Juhu, The Sanyas Ashram in Vile Parle(EAST), The Mount Mary Church in Bandra(West) and The Queens Necklace(Marine drive) In the evening after 6.30pm thats when the street lights are on. The Fancy Hotels you may want to book,  if I may suggest are J W Marriot by the sea in Juhu and The Continental at Marine drive overlooking the Arabian Sea.\nI wish I could suggest you more places which are mesmerising as they are a beautiful example of natural beauty and vibrant culture of India but unfortunately you have had some bad experiences with your stay in India which does not encourage me to recommend you these places. \nI only can hope that (if at all) you happen to visit India again then you have a wonderful stay which will erase your past bad experiences in India. All the best and happy travels! 👍",
      "Sorry you had to go through all of that... Really disturbing to think that this still happens in this day and age... I'm glad you got out of there... Take care Phoebe... sending positive vibes",
      "You're a strong personality and you handled it. A cautionary tale for others. But for Godness sake - don't put yourself in harms way again just for a YouTube Video. Welcome Home and Thank you for your efforts.",
      "I'm Indian, its not  a safe place at all, the western media is doing a propaganda on how great India is, and relate it to spirituality far from it, its not even civilized, Thailand & Bali has everything 10 times more than India could ever be, SKIP INDIA if you are a women, there are 100s of similar videos, and even then women get harassed online for saying the truth about India. \n\nKerala, Tamil Nadu,  and Mumbai is fine to an extent, southern India is ok, avoid Goa, Delhi, Jaipur, Much of North India. Glad you are fine, you did well considering the situation you were in, even some parts of Europe like Germany/France/UK has become unsafe for women but the media hides these facts. Only South East Asia is safe for Solo Women traveler it seems",
      "One thing i have noticed is having blonde hairs attracts 10x more attention in India than anything else. So if their is anything that makes you stand out in a foreign country then think about it.",
      "So sorry to hear this.India is not a place to be Pheobe. Its not the place that we see in the beautiful Indian movies. Some of my relatives have been to India and I am sorry to say that all of them said ,they will never ever think of going there again. Some  SL Buddhists go to India on pilgrimage but their experiences are not much different to yours.",
      "please first read all 🙏🏻then anyone is free to criticise me.\n\n🙏🏻You're so brave to post your real good and bad experiences 👍🏻 Travelers get scared to post their honest opinions because of thinking of online harassment even after going to their home country, but it's important for those who want to solo travel in the future, especially white females. There are not that many videos online about men's bad behavior in India. So many videos on how beautiful the country is, tasty spicy food, friendly people, family-oriented people, etc that's why travelers think it's gonna be wonderful but it's not! \n\n**About these online comments they are mostly teenagers who are in their puberty they think they are the king of the world they can do anything, thirsty/horny men who watch porn a lot and are brainwashed**\nWith time those comments will get less you have to learn to ignore them because you can't stop them.\nBut thirsty people from any country will always be gonna be there in any female DM's \n\nWe're 1.4B people and the core problem in this country is the education system which separates boys and girls from each other since their school age. It makes them keep their distance and only talk not touching. To control this schools put CCTV cameras also and monitor if someone hugging or holding hands etc. If they do it, they call their parents and it's very embarrassing to parents because they are the old generation, conservating thinking. And girls are always taught by their parents not to question especially men and elders. Such kids especially boys become men like these who harass women even in their families they think that they own the females. \n\nThis country is a patriarchal society run by politicians and the police are not free like in the Western countries where they have the power to handcuff and jail politicians when they are not wearing masks during covid times. Here police are under politicians. And for police at the top level, it's like they have very powerful backing for them. That's why at the local level police don't take such things seriously for local women also. For travelers if the worst thing happens like r*pe and if it gets to national news then it's very shameful for the country then police act so fast that we local people get shocked that our police can work so fast 🫨 \n\nIt happened to a Spanish Brazilian couple 1 month ago they posted one-hour video about it You can search for it on YouTube \" WE THOUGHT WE WERE KILLED IN INDIA - Around the world by motorcycle \" Or \" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nKNgV1zSjs&t=153s \"\n\nSearch this on Google \" National Commission of Women Chairperson, Rekha Sharma's response to a foreigner complaining about sexual harassment faced by female travellers in India \" OR  \" https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianModerate/comments/1b5e3tr/national_commission_of_women_chairperson_rekha/?rdt=39729 \" look how females respond to such things in India 🤯😵\n\none politician said in a public rally that r*pists are kids sometimes mistakes happen 🤯😵 and people especially men were cheering for that. \" https://indianexpress.com/article/political-pulse/mulayam-singh-yadav-questions-death-penalty-for-rape-says-boys-make-mistakes/ \" \n\nNow you will have an idea of what kind of mentality this society has. The only way to correct it is through education at the school level, making boys and girls hang out with each other physical touch is natural, sex education about Harmons, puberty, protections, etc but to get such education we have to pay very high price and only rich people can afford it. But who can't afford normal, poor people and those becomes harassers later in life. \n\nThis society is stuck in a loop! The loop can be broken by reforms in the education system but those will only happen if politicians want and I said what kind of politician do we have and to afford that kind of education you have to be rich! 🤦🏻🤷🏻",
      "So Indian men haven’t changed, I see 😢 It sounds similar to what I went through in 1984 when I was in my 20s. I was actually on a group tour, so I had Aussies and NZers around me. However,  Indian men still tried to invite themselves into my room, and stared at me everywhere I went. No mobile phone cameras in those days, thankfully.",
      "Thanks for sharing ! Must have been so scary for you. India is the worst place for single female travellers. Females get raped and murdered. I was scammed when I was in Mumbai. It was a shame cause I wanted to experience the culture, cut my travel short. DO NOT GO THERE IF YOU ARE A FEMALE SINGLE TRAVELLER !",
      "I’m very sorry that you have to go through it on your own. I have no hard feelings for Indians or the country in general, but I’d say India is not the safest country for solo travel, especially women. I’m glad that you finally left the country, things could have been worse. I hope this won’t stop you from travelling though. Please do come back to Vietnam 🇻🇳, I’m sure there are lots of places for you to discover. \nSafe travels",
      "To specially ladies Please don't go India alone, 99 percent you won't be safe, if you come with groups then it's okay still you need to be careful... India has full of mental people when it comes to women.. They are just crazy when they see white women.....",
      "Don't expect the local police or authorities will help. It's a delusion.\nIndia is very corrupt, in fact it's one of the most corrupt countries in the world (according to Transparency International). And you should have known that nothing can improve in a very corrupt country.",
      "You’re very brave for sharing this horrible experience. This is the best way to fight against those cowards. I’m glad your fine.",
      "Hello Phoebe, as a non resident Indian I completely understand how disgusted you felt about this whole experience. No matter how much you sugar coat your overall experience, the reality is India is a shit hole. Its a gutter. Its the country where 3 women were paraded na*ed by a mob of more than 50 people, videographed and gangr***d. Some even supported the act!! Its the country where gang r@p***s and murderers are garlanded and considered as \"men of good virtue\". You should not have come here alone. I suggest please visit China. Its a beautiful country, 100 times more developed than India and extremely safe. Probably the safest.",
      "Will you come jaipur ( pink city) ???",
      "So sorry you had this happen Phoebe. I have heard about this behavior over there before but figured it was overstated, I can only say I wish that society had sorted this pack mentality out but sadly not. We as men need to do more to squash this neanderthal behavior from our behavior. I can only apologies on behalf of those idiots who acted so poorly",
      "Hello Phoebe. I have been following your videos for some time now. It's very sad what happended to you. India is such a beautiful country with lots of culture. Unfortunately mentality wise for Indian men especially a lonely white girl is a feast. I wish you all the best for your future travels and continue making such interesting and informative videos. Hope to see making a video on my country one day Mauritius Island.",
      "Very sad to hear all of this, being an Indian and also being part of the Travel Industry! I travelled to Australia last December and your videos helped me immensely, I was so excited to see how you'd cover India (especially the north indian leg of the tour as thats what we serve) but i am just really sorry for your experience!",
      "Phoebe I’m so sorry for your bad experience in India this never should happen to western women but constantly does if women don’t travel with drivers recommend by other women who have travelled India! I have travelled India now 15 year solo and met Shakir 13 years ago he has a wife 3 daughters and he books my hotels where I eat and is now like my brother. Unfortunately tour companies are not ethical in India they are just in it for money as are the drivers and guides. Please only use private drivers recommend by westerners who have travelled India before! Unfortunately India has this terrible attitude towards women, it is a pack mentality and it’s scary! Women in India never stay alone it’s just not safe, it’s a very dangerous place for women who don’t have connection contacts in India 🇮🇳 pls use safe drivers from other westerners! Anyone who needs Shakirs phone number please ask if he’s unavailable he will give you on to others he trusts so you will be safe. Unfortunately the police in India are corrupt so the country continues to be very unsafe for western people, sad but true! You must have Indian friends to help you travel safely 🤷‍♀️",
      "OMG. How terrifyingly horrible for u. My heart goes out to u. I did gdt the feeling that India was not the best experience for you. You did feel uncomfortable and that came through on ur vids. Its disgusting that u can't travel to foreign country as a woman and get sexually harassed. And as for the comment u get in DMs and emails, there is no need for it. I personally have seen some comments that go over the line here. Im glad ur home (u may already be on another adventure to). Thank you for speaking out and telling solo woman travellers about ur experience. It may save a life. And men all over the world need to learn that NO is a complete sentence.",

      "❤❤❤❤❤❤❤.Take care Phoebe 💟....I hope next time when you decide to visit a new country you've to read about it generally, however when talking about India, naturally in a huge and populated country someone would expect anything bad that can happen especially with a solo girl.......I hope one day you will visit my country Tunisia and the Arab world in general...❤",

      "Hi there mam.\nI admire your points that you have given in this video.  And I'm so sorry for the bad experience that you have felt.\nI'm from Shimla. If you and your friend come to India and want to do solo trip.\nYou either go really north of India (Jammu and Kashmir, Ladak, Himachal) or really south(Kerla) or north east 7 sisters state (Arunachal, Nagaland etc).\nPeople in these places won't bother you or ask for pictures. People are nice here and you would feel comfortable there. Even Indian girls go to these states and have no issues even at night.\nOther hindi speaking states are big no no... They have no population and you don't know what going to happen. Even I get culture shock when I get out of my town to hindi belt. People are loud, have no respect for others and have no idea of others consent.",
      "Sorry to hear about your experience. It must have been difficult for you throughout the trip. Would recommend booking through reputed travel agent.",
      "Oh dear that is terrible Phoebe.  We love our trips to India but unfortunately there is an all to well documented theme of this kind of pathetic behaviour.  Apart from how scared and horrible you feel the real shame is that India is a fascinating country.  It just has some serious cultural and criminal issues that make it unsafe for single or even small groups of women.   BTW, it is SO important that you posted this video even though it was clearly painful to make.",
      "If you had tried to get the authorities to help, they probably would have told you how foolish you were to walk alone while white and pretty.",
      "As an Indian, I feel quite upset after hearing about these incidents. A few individuals, particularly those without proper education, are causing problems because they lack the skills to interact appropriately with tourists. It's crucial for India to focus on educating people about tourism and improving their communication skills. I am sure these are only 5% of the people causing problems, but ruining entire country's name.",
      "Tourist scams in India has always been happening but since the advent of the Hindu nationalist BJP government things have gotten so much worse as the government promotes the idea that everyone except Russians are enemies of India. As bad as it was for you, it's a million times worse for Muslims and orientals in India, and even their own people the Dalits or untouchables.",
      "I’m sorry you went through that.",
      "That Pashmina kind of Tuktuk affiliate marketing happens in other South East Asian countries too. In Bangkok they take you to Pearl/Stone shop and try to sell you expensive stones.\n\nFor rest of it, it is only India from what I know unfortunately. I felt disgusted hearing it, wish there was a solution. I am not yet, but would be very scared to a girl's father in places like these.",
      "Why come to India go some other better places.",
      "It depends on,you are Introvert or Extrovert or how you handle situation into your favour its so easy to control them to act accordingly as you want just don't fear and with confidence & openness talk & have boundaries",
      "India is a great place for solo tourists but only if you are MALE. Female solo travelers: avoid at all costs, especially North India. The Delhi-Agra-Jaipur triangle is particularly bad with vicious predators and scam artists.",
      "I’m so sorry, this is just gross and I can’t even begin to imagine what you went through. I really hope you’re doing OK ❤",
      "My Fiance and I watch your videos (Canada, Singapore, Japan, Korea) and we could feel the tenseness throughout your journey in India. You recorded such beautiful landmarks but it's unacceptable you had to deal with all those layers of harassment. The content you make is amazing and we wish you all the strength and prayers to move past this experience to get back the Phoebe we all know and love. The honesty of saying what you don't and do like keeps us engaged in a respectful way. Some travel vloggers over do it with how amazing everything is, but in reality it's not always greener on the other side. We can't wait to see where you end up next :)",
      "Phoebe I'm really sorry that you had to go through all of that. Please do consider traveling with a male friend that is strong and imposing. There are good Indian people and bad ones too. I had the experience with both. I spoke the truth about my experiences in India and got quite a bit of hateful comments calling me a liar and more.",

      ":(",

      "Whaaaaat? I saw one or two of your videos in India (only some parts, I´m not interest in that place) and I thought you were sick, or feeling under the weather... I never imagined that kind of nightmare: I am really glad you are alive. When you told what happened inside the hotels I got goosebumps; and I'm from México, \"the place where all the bad things are supposed to happen\", but I've never heard anything like that. Perhaps you should upload new videos showing all the scary moments; do it for all the women that like you are solo travelers.\nPlease learn your lesson: stay safe.",
      "Saddened but not shocked.\n\nIts common for some men in India to grab any opportunity to touch women inappropriately.Festivals like Holi are just the perfect place for such people.Thats why most of my family members in India try to spend at home instead of venturing out on the streets especially in Delhi and surrounding areas.\n\nMy advice for someone traveling alone especially women is to stay only in reputed hotels.I generally travel alone and only stay at Radisson,Marriott or Ramada.They also help you out with cabs,which cost a lot more but are much safer than other means of transport.",
      "So incredibly sorry that this happened to you Phoebe.. thank you for sharing, I can only imagine how difficult it was to live through this but so brave of you to share your experiences.\nNot going to lie I teared up throughout this whole episode, you don't deserve to be treated like this- no one does. I encourage you to take the rest you need ❤",

      "I'll tell you something all the bad experiences you have had, you will never experience in Mumbai, Kerala, southern part of India in general. Pretty sure it was the North Indian tourist in Goa that chased you for a photo. Its typical uneducated North indian behavior\n People are highly educated, civilized and there's a huge huge difference in culture and mentality of people in south compared to North India.\nIf North India didn't exist India would be a top 10 tourist destination in the world and easily a superpower by now. \nSorry that you had such a bad experience\n\nIndia needs to delete northern states or completely ban tourism for foreigners until the people there are taught basic manners.. fkin north indian clowns super bad representation of Indians both domestic and abroad",
      "sorry to heard that phoebe.. glad you are okay.. if that kinda happen in the hotel.. 100% staff of the hotel involved.. its better you to check a hidden spy cam before you sleep.. there is some cheap gadged that sold in online market to detect hidden cam...",
      "Please do not ever ignore your instinct.",
      "Sadly most tourist areas are hounded by these low class folks with no civic sense whatsoever, its public so you can't even shoo them off, I also do not feel safe as an Indian guy much less a solo female traveller. Hopefully it will get better, this govt seems infinitely more competent than last ones.",
      "As an Indian and a regular viewer of this channel, it's heartbreaking to hear, I am aware of the selfie menace  that many foreign tourists face, it probably comes from the ingrained sense of white skin supremacy, what the colonisers left us with but things happening to the extent that you narrated, it's absolutely shocking and unacceptable, did you intimate your embassy in India and reached out to the tourist helpline? Also share your Tour Operator's details with the respective authorities or make it public, what you narrated is horrifying and it needs to be dealt appropriately.\n\n\nAlso if any other potential tourist is reading this, please don't travel this way, it's the most disastrous way to explore India possibly!",

      "It's awful you had this experience. I wish you shared the tour company's name that you used. Maybe, in future it may help to connect with other legit  YouTubers in any country who can give you a better approach. I know Karl Rock from New Zealand has posted similar videos on the scams in India. Safe travels.",
      "That is how many Indian men in India are and unfortunately reflects on the culture .. a total shame!  not too uncommon for Indian women to experience similar, though things get more out of control when a beautiful white girl or boy walks their neighborhoods.. obsession with white people is still something crazy there.  While I'm not from India, I've visited South India and people tell me that its relatively better / safer there - less harassment.  The thing you noticed about Indians having a 'pack mentality' is quite common.. when one attacks someone, the rest jump in and join.\r\n\r\nA few things I've learned while visiting India - \r\n\r\n1) Always better to travel in a group\r\n2) Stay in mid-top tier hotels - they often have better security, and are faster and better when responding to your needs\r\n3) When traveling in trains, choose first class, or better..  do not travel in a lower class.\r\n4) Taking a rickshaw is fine in places where traffic is very light, like in rural areas.  But in cities where traffic is dense, take taxi / cab / Uber / etc.. this goes back to your safety.. plus you will inhale less toxic fumes.\r\n5) Be careful of ALL 'holy men/women'.. many are scammers or simply just out to get money or sex from those they prey upon... in the name of God.  \r\n\r\nThe big question is, what will President Modi do in his third term to protect tourists?  Unfortunately, till today India is referred to as the 'rape capital' of the world.. by foreigners / outsiders.. there's a reason for that.  Foreigners should generally feel safe traveling anywhere in India without being harassed or feeling unsafe.",
      "I am glad you are safe. Thanks for sharing",
      "Hello Pheobe! First of all Im really sorry for what you have experienced ! Even i'm not okay with that. Every country has the same thing somthing or other, if you are from US, we brown people are harrased! its not always about the sexual thing! the ways of harrasment are different in diff countries. And for the fact you have uploaded videos and edited like you have the best experience for the sake of the growth(Views). After all that you are telling these like you should avoid INDIA in your decision making?! The major wrong step you took was your PLAN! It was totally wrong, why ill say( Its like i planned for mexico and blaming US ). See, for the fact Crime, Sexual Abuse, Hate is every where in the world. It doesnt mean that that only INDIA has that. Its Just, you know where to escape in your own country and you just have left it. Just dont Demean things! I know its your personal opinion, But there are travellers who took taking photos with you as positive note. Its just you are uncomfortable, that doesnt mean the country is not safe. Anyways, thanks for visiting INIDA, and once again sorry !!!!!!!",
      "attractive woman in an unfamiliar country, there are those that will see this as an opportunity to be exploited.  This is not unique to India, can be a thing in some places in the Middle East as well.  When traveling solo as a woman in India best to connect with established locals or fellow travelers via social media groups.",
      "I m really.sorry that you had to endure all of this...its really shameful and deplorable ...I m.fro. Mumbai and I can say that mumbai is comparatively safer and progressive than the rest of India esp north India ....I myself have experienced this kind of behavior of all places in goa...I had to confront guys who were trying to click pics with my girlfriend who was an Indian and some of them were shooting on the sly ..camera phones are a bane and these sickos don't understand the concept of personal space and gender etiquette. \n\nIf you ever plan to visit India again please go for a reputed tour agency there are a some really good agencies out here that really take good care of their guests and ensure their safety ...take care and happy travels",
      "Please go to  Sri Lanka. more safer country.",
      "Dr.Akashh here Phoebe, I’ve been watching you since a year or so from India. Always loved your positivity n energy. Feels really bad that you’ve had a terrible experience. Apologies from India. I hope these uneducated people get some life n learn to behave with women. Loads of love n cheers to you. Stay charming as you are.",
      "Hey, it actually seems kinda normal to me, after all, one can read on the local news in India about women being assaulted on the street or on the bus, and the local officials even say, isn't it true that when women walk on the street, they are craving to be assaulted by men? I still find it hard to believe what kind of culture makes this kind of thing commonplace!",
      "It's really terrible and horrifying that you have to go through that. I hear similar story before. Normally I watch every video you make except last few from india, I started a coupe of your India video briefly, then I can felt something is not right couple minutes into the video, than I just skip the rest. Because that's not the place I would go,  even company paid me to and offer free everything include previously. You are unbelievable brave to go there. And this one you are yourself, bit shaky but the real you. I know plenty wonderful people from india through my career with my previous company. But certain mentality, value, behaviour, how people treating each other are hard to change. Wish you all the best, and hope you getting better with time. You want to cover diversity and make good video, from less developed countries to developed place around the world, I admire your professionalism, but don't risk your life and wellbeing for it.",
      "Oh Phoebe! My heart was breaking while watching this video! I am soo sorry about what you endured in India and beyond! I was basically holding my breath at the thought of something happening to you…it must have been so scary! 😢\nThank you so much for opening up about your experiences, no one should ever be treated with such blatant disrespect!!\nI am so glad you got out of there and are now safe! Sending all my love.❤",
      "Hi Phoebe, Nancy here.  So sorry to hear about this!  Why were they so intent on taking pictures?  Is there some monetary motivation?  Do they sell them or is it just to get close to you?  You are actually lucky, they could have surrounded you and taken you away forever for sex trafficking!  This is so scary!  I am headed to South Africa, Cape town and Victoria Falls in September, BY MYSELF this time!  Seeing your story, I'm nervous.  I am planning for being picked up at airports and driven to my safari camp directly. A luxury camp called the white lion!   Same with being take back to Cape Town airport to fly to Victoria Falls.  When in Victoria Falls I will be staying at the Victoria Falls Safari Club lodge, top of the line.  And on my last leg I am out of Cape Town proper to stay at a hotel with restaurants so I do not have to walk around by myself.  I am also planning to do the big marine five!  A boat tour to see whales, sharks, dolphins, african penguins and seals!  I think I will be okay.  Wanna join me?  LOL  Safety in numbers!",
      "Tk care",
      "I am going to Hoi A soon, did you feel safe there? I am feeling anxious after your India experience❤",
      "❤❤❤ hey Phoebe, so sorry this happened. Big hug, from one female solo traveler to another❤",
      "I feel very ashamed after hearing this story. This kind of video makes me depressed😢. I don't know why some Indian man behaves in such a bad way towards foreigners. I also travel abroad a lot but I feel ashamed to call myself an Indian.😔😔",
      "Last few months a Spanish couple got rap*d badly by a gang. So watchout all the time, Phoebe. When I was in India, even as a man I didn't feel safe at all. People need to travel in group. It's good that you got away from India. Seeing your other videos, I thought about warning you not going to India, but it seem you already went there. I did vow I will never go back to India when I left, at least for the next 10 years.",
      "wonder what makes u think it was safe to begin with.",
      "Im so sorry to hear what happened to you. Its gut wrenching. At the same time Im very glad you made it safe back home. Dont stop speaking up and telling your story. Lots of love❤️",
      "As an Indian man really very sorry you felt and faced the negative side of being in India , Yes there are some who still think about women in this regard and its same for any girl but probably you faced the worst of it & can understand because I too have a sister , female friends and Wife who struggles in front of these handful Men\nJust want to say pls dont loose hope in India and not all are like this\nI can understand if in future you opt out to return here but out of 1.4B people few 100 are not worth to talk about, \nIndia currently is in transitioning phase and lot of things in future will change especially more stern laws and people being afraid of them",
      "Oh no Phoebe.  I’m so sorry that you had to go through such a harrowing experience in parts of your India trip.   I know it look a lot of courage for you to speak so freely about this.   But, that is one thing I have always appreciated about your travel chronicles is your honesty to your community.   And I think this is valuable information.   I know it’s going to take some time, but I hope at some point, you’ll be able to put these experiences behind you.   Continue to be who you are and don’t let this sidetrack you.",
      "Sorry to hear all the bad things happened to you even in Goa, its considered as safe place for women, not trying to justify anything but the domestic tourists from other parts of India create a mess in Goa, they just harass people, even locals dont like them. Incase you want to come back start from south goa further down the states like Karnataka, Kerala, much safer. Also name the travel agents who booked you and left you alone.",
      "Thank you for sharing this as it will help other women. A girl from my city was r*ped when she visited India. While going to the hospital and while reporting it there were men taking selfies with her. And men even now found her and send her lots of dms with disgusting comments, so I do understand you, it is truly terrifying. I'm very sorry this happened to you, very disgusted, and, thank you for sharing for other women to see they are not alone. Also, I heard many horror stories especially during holi festivity, but in general every girl going there had a horrible time and had terrifying experiences with drivers and hotel people even. Very shocking, hope this changes, it cannot continue to be like this, even for Indian women and what they have to endure...",
      "OMG..really sorry that you had to go through this. I actually saw your Mumbai video a few days back and it was so funny with your guide taking over describing things, it all seemed so pleasant. Looking at your  reactions to him there,  wouldn't ever have imagined that you would have been put through so much in the earlier part of your trip. Kudos to you for being so strong and optimistic to make every moment count. And then to have to go through an even worse phase again.. I am really sorry & disappointed that this happened to you. No matter what anyone says there is no justification for people to behave like this. I am Indian, and you are spot on for sharing your experience with everyone. Ofcourse everyone  is not like this, but then  anyone should not have to go through this aswell. Please keep sharing so others can learn and not go through such experiences. Stay happy & blessed. Cheers.",
      "I’m so sorry that you had this experience in my country. I live in Bombay and sadly other than Bombay and most parts of Bangalore - being a woman is quite tough in most parts of the country. More power to you and you don’t deserve this",
      "I am sorry to hear about your experiences. Really horrible. This is indeed sad for a country that worships women. You must write to the Indian Consulate in Canberra. Sadly it is also the same for Indian women itself. Very sad indeed.",
      "So sorry you had such a horrible experience. The part about the hotel is insane. Was the hotel part of a chain? If so you should complain with their head office.",
      "Yes 👍 you are right",
      "Hi Phoebe, how are you today? Thank you so much for your honesty and for sharing this with us. I'm genuinely glad to see you're physically okay. I understand that it may be difficult for your mind to let go of the guilt you're feeling, but I truly believe that one day you will realize it's not you, it's them. It's not your fault. You have a beautiful soul and a lovely spirit. Your curiosity needs to be nourished, and traveling does just that. It's not bad; it's amazing.\n I empathize with everything you've gone through as a woman and as a traveler. Thank you so much for giving this advice, especially to us. \nI also understand how challenging it is to receive these kinds of comments, but in the end, I always pay attention to the kindest ones. They bring light and hope, which is something very rare to find, especially on social media. You're an incredible woman, an amazing person, and now you have this experience that has taught you: you have to follow your instincts.\n You're powerful, you're worthy of respect and love. \nThank you for sharing your amazing trips with us, with all the ups and downs. Thank you for your soul. Thank you for the incredible vibe you transmit. I wish you all the best.",
      "Sad to hear that your experience was such a traumatizing one. Hearing about your experience makes me realize that we have much to improve on public place safety and the overall experience of a tourist by working on many different aspects. Clearly, having places to visit, fancy hotels, and eateries is not enough to create a safe tourism ecosystem. As an Indian who takes pride in the Indian culture of hospitality, it is very sad to hear that someone had to experience these kinds of things here. Call it self-criticism but respect for personal space and consent is generally quite low here, and that's something that seriously needs to be addressed. Sharing your experience was a very good thing I would say, these issues need to be acknowledged if we want to solve them. Bravo, for completing the tour despite the challenges and I really hope you have a much better experience if you ever visit India again.",
      "There are good people & bad people every where in the world.  \nTraveling teach us, how to avoid bad people & at the same time, how to enjoy the tour. \nYou are a brave women who did traveling in India despite western media always shows only negative things about India.",
      "Hi Phoebe, I am an Indian & i really felt bad knowing your experience during your visit to India. I apologize on behalf of my fellow citizens bringing down name of whole country. I understand that you may not be travelling back to India soon but if and whenever you are visiting India, I would like to  host you your trip, as a small token of respect from we Indians. Believe me, India and most of the Indians are beautiful and respectful. Hope you get to see the real side of Indians soon.",
      "first of all sorry to hear you had to face that. In india there still is tonnes of social awareness especially about other person's personal space that needs to get developed.\nUnfortunately two centuries of back breaking colonial rule that led to absolute destruction of their social-human-self awareness, and preceding that the 500 years of islamic rule, and what you see there now are people not in touch with their own dna, their own intelligence and they are lost in a mish-mash of cultures(their own, islamic influence, western influence). And during colonial rule all of their wealth was stolen, estimated about $45 T (yes T not B) and they were forced into being destitute farmers and laborers, and generations of social awareness and intelligence just desecrated and literally burnt to death(the sages were burnt to death because they were seen as the wise in the community to be removed in order to destroy people's understanding of life-their cultural heritage, and gain control over them). It is unfortunate and we hope and pray that they reclaim their identities and build their backbones again, and understand that their behavior is animalistic at best and absolutely not done from a sense of self. When they see you, subconciously they see a wealthy well put together human being and unfortunatley their lower energies take charge because they still lack a strong sense of self. Thats why the right wing government there is very crucial, left wing governement exacerbates such loose-loose behavior there when it comes to identity. I keep bringing identity up because it is at the root of this animalistic-unruly behavior. \nApologies again, it is unfortunate, and if you can please send this video to the Tourism ministry of India, they absolutely need to start a campaign to bring more social awareness into people about their behavior towards foreigners and that incessantely asking for pictures of following someone is absolutely unacceptable and unruly behavior. I know its not your job to and you've already done enough with this video, but i see this video and all this work you have already done as an opportunity to build upon! Please if you can reach out to the Tourism Ministry in India with a small letter giving them an idea of a campaign to spread awareness with one or two specific scary and unruly behaviors like aggressive photo asking, then that can hopefully snowball into actually becoming a conscious awareness in peoples minds there so they can grow as well into better humans.",
      "As an Indian, I feel ashamed to know you had such an unpleasant experience in our country. No means No but for some people it's very difficult to accept it and their so called ego gets hurt. For these men they think foreign women are an easy target which is really sickening. Cat calling and harassing women is unacceptable.",
      "Hi, glad you spoke about your experience . \nIt also happened with the local people . \nI hope somebody will work on these things one day",
      "Indian men are like that, they are crazy about white girls. Next time, be super careful when traveling alone to India",
      "100% dangerous in India for solo female travellers. You were lucky no one managed to successfully break into your hotel room. Suggest you add a safety warning to your Indian travel videos in case viewers watch those but miss this.",
      "I'm really sorry you had this experience. Honestly sounds awful. I cannot imagine how bad that felt for you. So glad your safe and your sharing this. Safety is always #1 priority. Hopefully sharing this gives others an idea of how things are for women. Your feelings and your experiences are valid and important. Hope you stay safe and you start to feel better soon. Hopefully this all stops. And people get a clue of how to treat people",
      "South Indian culture is very different from North. Kerala, TN, Andra, Karnataka. more educated and respectful of women. Never go alone traveling to these northern states alone. But if you go go there with your friends as a group. Also always check with Indian embassy about travel agents. I’m sure they will help. Also please make a complaint to the embassy about your travel experience",
      "To all the women out there  think 100 times  before you decide to solo travel India   its not for eveyone  unless u know someone  whom you can trust",
      "So sad. \nBut the reality is almost all western people prefer to go Delhi Jaipur Agra these 3 cities. Even we Indians didnt visited delhi for tour. I am not saying North India is not safe but except these 3 cities there are bunch of cities and travel destinations in North India as well South India.",
      "You can see their lust in their eyes when they see a western woman.",
      "If this happened to you, first of all it is very bad, this should not have happened. You cannot live in a country like 1.4 billions India men's are extremely \"dangerous\" if you so much problem you should go back to Australia or something else have a good journey..",
      "Whoaaa I was in India in 2011. I am not a female and amount of photos ppl wanted to take with me was insane. I know it probably won’t help but why not report your guide to Police & especially hotel staff at Jaipur and Goa?? Since I am sure you stayed at cheapest hotels",
      "There’s this stereotype of Indian men being the most horny men in the world, and it’s for a reason. I’m glad you could get out of there, horrible culture",
      "You are s bright soul keep doing your work",
      "I’m so sorry to hear this was your experience and thank you for your honesty. I’ve wanted to visit India, however I am also a woman solo traveller and have been extremely hesitant to book a trip there. Your experience sounded terrifying and I hope you’re doing okay.",
      "Oh heck! I'd like to say more but I'd be kicked off  You Tube. How dare they?! India is somewhere I'd like to visit but this is all concerning . Thank you for sharing your experience even though it was totally crappy.",
      "As an Indian, sorry for what happened to you...Yes, few people do take things as granted here and dont think the right way...strict policing definitely needs to be improved in tourist places",
      "As an Indian, I would apologize for any inconvenience or misunderstanding you may have experienced. It's important to recognize that India, as the most populous country in the world, boasts a rich and diverse culture, with people from various economic and social backgrounds. While India is a beautiful and vibrant place to visit, it is essential to be mindful of your choices regarding accommodations and tours to ensure a pleasant and memorable experience. Selecting reputable hotels and guided tours can significantly enhance your stay and help you appreciate the unique charm and hospitality of India.",
      "I am glad you are safe and sound ❤treat it as an experience",
      "Oh boy, this sounds very bad! I suggest you send a detailed note to the Ministry of Tourism and probably the Indian High Commission in Australia about this. \n\nClearly we aren't a country for solo women travellers. \n\nReally sad!",
      "Phoebe, I've just watched your blog. If I could, I would give you a big 🇦🇺 Australian hug, Im blon away what you have told us  im lost for words ,people in this world really need to wake up to themselves well as I follow you from one Aussie to another please take care when travelling  yeah,Take care",
      "As an indian. ..I am sorry this happened to you...I am in travel trade and incidents like these are really creating very bad impression ..We may have a solution for this types of incidents..A startup providing security/guides .Be safe ...",
      "The best way to avoid this kind of awful experience is that dont visit India. especially the female solo traveller",
      "Thank you for sharing. I was wondering about your genuine experience in India as a female. When I saw your first video I was actually inspired to visit someday because it’s a place I never really wanted to go but places have a reputation for a reason. It doesn’t come from nowhere.",
      "So sorry for horrible experiences. As an Indian who lived in Australia for years- feels terrible to hear about your  experiences- when women ask me for travel suggestions i point them to south east Asia and east Asia \nHopefully you get better psychologically soon",
      "Sorry to hear what happened & I'm not surprised. It's hard being a Solo Female Traveller in India, especially North India. I'd always suggest to travel with a partner / in group when you travel in Delhi / UP / Rajasthan - men are very notorious in that part of the country. I hope you'll look past this experience & appreciate the beauty of India.",
      "This happens only in  India ... yeah The North East Indians also face the same thing time and again... anyways one should be very careful when travelling the mainland.. but than you ... you enlighted us more as I left India for more than  20 years... \nnext time be safe",
      "I am curious what agency did you book? Maybe it would have helped if you booked with a more mainstream agency like G adventures or Intrepid travel.",
      "I heard of stories specially after Holi that it is terrible place for women . Rape is a real thing in india i hear, I am sorry this happened to you.",
      "I'm so sorry this happened to you. I know  it's hard to put out a video that not is not all positive, but I appreciate you telling the truth of your experience.",
      "This India .. no wonder.\nUnsafe place for men and women (Tourists).\nThink always of safety during your travel…",
      "Been ti India once\n11 days\nGolden Triangle\nInteresting\nBut never go there again",
      "Omg phoebe that is so scary, especially the incident of the door 💔💔 imagine you didn't barricade the door in a foreign country 😭😭.  Glad that you are safe and I hope India tourism board or ministers see these videos and make a change. I hope that you are somewhere safe and somewhere you can just regroup and be calm sending love 🌹",
      "Thanks for sharing your real experience.\n\nI have personally asked a few men to stop taking pictures who were forcing themselves on foreign women. Accompanied the ladies and walked along until they reached their huts and made them feel safe. It's disheartening when our very own country men behave in such a way.\n\nIf only we could make India safer, especially for women, what a country we would have been.\n\nI feel right kind of education should be imparted among men from their parents and teachers at a young age so that they start respecting others' personal spaces and understand the fact that a *no* means *No* .\n\nHope your next visit to India is good. Wish you well.",
      "very sorry to hear about your experience in India  as an Indian i am ashamed of what happened really to you i personally wouldn't suggest any female solo traveler to visit India i mean i will not suggest even an Indian girl to travel solo across the country . please travel in group & best is to have a local travel with you to avoid these type of scams & harassments . i am surprised with what happened in goa specially because its a tourist state & many foreigners visit goa specially solo female travelers from Russia . Mumbai is quiet safe city as i live here i have a fair idea but delhi agra rajasthan are not for solo female travelers . as a solo traveler south & Gujarat would be safe in my opinion but still please travel in company & i know you won't feel like coming here again & we have no right to convince you to please come again after what you experienced but if at all you plan to visit you are most welcome & i would suggest you get a good tour operator to avoid these bad experience as you can travel in group all the time or connect with some indian family & also have an emergency number on your speed dial like a 112 which is valid across pan india . take care & wish you luck & safe journey for all your future travels .",
      "Awww Phoebe, I'm so sorry you had such an awful experience. Thank you for being brave enough to share your experience. If you find yourself back in Singapore, I'll buy you the best Laksa in Katong. It won't change anything you went through but hopefully it would bring you a simple joy. Take care dear, stay strong. Also trust your instincts.",
      "Ok thanks for sharing. India Seems like a totally messed up country... Il stay away.",
      "Sickening. I'm so sorry. 😮 Thank you for sharing your experience. It is helpful!",
      "Apologies As an Indian citizen and travel enthusiast it is really annoying to hear from you that you had a bitter experience. Its always the few people who spoil the reputation of a whole. Yes I genuinely feel the matter needs to be addressed here in India how to behave with foreigners.",
      "I would not want to go to a country like India. Past experience tells us that this country is full of sexual assault and rape, and often the victims do not get justice. It is better to go to Japan, South Korea or even Thailand than to India.",
      "I'm so sorry for you to hear that. I'm nearly crying. I'm also a solo female traveler. I've never been in India but thats one of my biggest fears of traveling alone. Nobody should feel like that. I'm very glad that nothing worse happened - this was bad enough. I hope you can travel with a light heart and full of joy again. Big hug for you!!!!",
      "I watched your trip to Vietnam and how happy you enjoyed the trip there, maybe you can visit Vietnam again and share more videos",
      "This video needed to be made and shared.  As a male (not from India) I am APPALLED that you had to experience this.  As I have commented previously, I was considering going to India with my friend and co-worker, but I will not spend one penny of my money anywhere where someone was treated the way you were.  Not a chance.  On behalf of all the decent people of the world, I am so deeply sorry this happened to you.  NONE OF THIS WAS YOUR FAULT and you did not deserve that.  I admire your strength and courage and keep on vlogging, there are still good people and good places in this world.  India does not happen to be one of them.  I am so sorry.",
      "This is so awful. Watching this video has kinda freaked me out a bit. And unfortunately there are people like this everywhere in the world. This harassment is totally unacceptable and is one of the reasons why some people are afraid to travel. In our limited travel, we’ve at times felt unsafe / taken advantage of / scammed in countries like Malaysia and Taiwan. Even in my birthplace Hong Kong. And I’m talking about big tourist areas, not back streets. I’m sorry you’ve had to go through all of this. Thank you for sharing. I hope this doesn’t reduce your desire to travel. Take care",
      "That is such a horrific way to have had this trip end. You seemed to get happier with each new video in the series... I wasn't expecting things to go south before you left. Glad you got out physically unharmed though. \n\nI can only relate to the scams that you get taken to when on tours. But the sexual harassment and invasion of privacy women can face when traveling is a whole other level. Thank you for being brave enough to talk about this and help educate us on the matter. You should definitely upload a video on the less desirable moments of the trip to help promote awareness of what could happen.\n\nI hope the next trip goes better... maybe an R&R trip to Hawaii is in order.",
      "That’s like night and day difference when you visited Vietnam, Should Avoid Travelling INDIA at  All Cause !! \nShould Advise All the Viewers Not to Travel There Regardless!!\nGlad to see and hear you are safe & sounds !!",
      "Being an Indian , I'm ashamed and sorry for that , I'm devastated to hear that . The fact that nobody helped you was even worse to hear . Pls Just don't hate India in general , yeah it's easier said than done . I'm a male my self but I'm ashamed rn . Sorry from India . 😔😔😔",
      "Oh my god.. As an Indian man I am embarrassed😢",
      "After that experience, you really need to come to Copenhagen and visit some libraries and bookstores🙄\nBtw thanks for sharing",
      "This is absolutely awful, and as a solo male traveller this is something we usually don't have to deal with at all. I've had people stare at me or ask me weird questions, but that kind of harrassment is terrible, and certainly doesn't paint India as a nice place to visit.\nSerious question - do you believe you still would have been harrassed if you were in a group of say four or five women, or if you were there with even one male friend? So was the fact you were solo the main contributor, or do you think it was that you are fair skinned, young, pretty etc and hence would have been harrassed like this regardless? Because the first is still scary, but an obstacle that can be overcome through asking a few friends (or creating a group before you go) to tag along (of course this sort of ruins the solo travel, but at least it would be safer). The second option is pretty much impossible to overcome and means that the places you went are super unsafe for anyone who fits the \"pretty western women\" image - if thats the case, even as someone who would not face that kind of harassment, it would make me not want to go there and support a country's tourist industry when that country doesn't protect tourists properly.",
      "Phoebe, no woman should  never, ever have to experience what you went through. Hopefully, the authorities, the ministers of culture and tourism should be made aware of this situation so\nyou and many women who go to India are better protected when traveling there. Thank you for your sincere honesty, this video will help other women to be aware of unsafe situations.\nDon't let this situation prevent you from traveling to many other parts of the world. We want you to be safe and happy.  🙏    Harriet, Jim and Yuki",
      "Thank you for making this.  I was thinking about booking a tour there. Now I know I’ll have a miserable time. And can spend my hard earned money elsewhere.",
      "As an Indian male, I feel so sorry you had to go through all this, it's disgusting. You don't deserve this, no woman does. I hope this goes viral, brings some shame to the country & the authorities takes some action. Thats when people seem to care these days. \nI have always felt that the so-called Golden Triangle is overrated & unsafe for women, what surprised me was your experience in Goa which generally sees a lot of foreign tourists. I hope someday the men in this country learn to behave with women & you get to visit again & enjoy. But until then, advise to female solo travelers to avoid this country.",
      "Hey Pheobe, I don't know if you will see this message. Anyway, my bestie and I will be doing an india trip in October. I would love for you to join us and have a better time. Just watched your summary video on YouTube of india, ater watching all of yiur other inida videos. Our tour starts in Delhi and ends in Kathmandu, Nepal. We plan to fly back to Delhi to then fly home to Sydney. Obviously we are also Aussie.\nI hope you see this message. \nKindest regards \nAlex Munro \n🇦🇺💗💙",
      "Sorry to hear your experience in India. So brave you speak it out.",
      "無事でよかった😔\nまた日本に来てください😉",
      "Thank you for sharing your experience. It sucks you had to go through that and are still going through it. I hope your future travels are much more enjoyable. Whether you decide to take some time before your next trip or you get right back on the travel horse, be safe, happy and healthy.",
      "I’m glad you are ok, and sorry you had to go through that.Sounds quite terrifying and that behaviour is unacceptable as you have said. Look after yourself and recover.  I hope you have a better experience at your next destination.",
      "That is truly disgusting wow what a failed society. I’m sure you have saved some women from going through this or god forbid something worse happening to them.",
      "Also I really feel sorry for the amount of times you had to feel so uncomfortable, no human should go through such circumstances. Unfortunately, a lot of India's population comprise of illiterate teens and you really cant escape them given the overpopulation in the country.",
      "Very sorry to hear that about my country. But I can assure you all Indian men are not like that as I am a man too. Looks like your tour company was a shit. Although I am ashamed I would still say you to visit India again and explore north east of India. I live in Kolkata and I can say that its not like that here. People are extremely helpful.",
      "Hey its true its less safe for solo female travellers in north.",
      "I'm so sorry to hear that 😢 Men like this should be in jail, straight up. On another note, I don't know if you asked Indians about their opinions on where to visit before actually visiting. I think most people would have recommended skipping the Golden Triangle. It's a tourist trap. And when staying in those 3 cities I would recommend staying at reputable hotels. I stayed at a Mariott hotel in Agra during my Taj Mahal trip, no issues with security there. They even do bag-checks before anyone enters. Anyone that is not Indian and reading this, just skip the Golden Triangle. Touch down at Bengaluru and explore the south or go to Mumbai then go to the Northeast.",
      "Did you watch Josie lift things vlog channel. She is also an Australian who visited india and other asian countries. She had different experiences compared to you. I hope you ok now and feeling much better now",
      "Phoebe that’s awful just awful! I am so sorry that you experienced such appalling harassment from all those involved. I am really anxious about my upcoming trip, I’m doing the golden triangle route like you did and I guess the only thing that gives me comfort is my mum’s going with me. Thank you for being so honest, the vlogs out there are a bit different person to person. I appreciate you sharing your experience xo",
      "Phoebe thats horrible it can be a very scary experience travelling as a girl even though im a guy and ive never been in such a situation i feel so sorry for you that is very gross behaviour nobody should be treated like that you are very brave",
      "Your experience was bloody awful! No way! India is incredibly unsafe for female solo vloggers. I hope and pray you feel better soon, Phoebe... I admire your courage to speak up. I hope this video helps others to think multiple times before visiting India... It seems like it is far from a safe place ...",
      "Sorry to hear you had to (and still) endure such inappropriate behaviour / treatment - it is every solo female travellers worst nightmare! We all truly appreciate your honest and balanced review of your experiences and appreciate the courage it takes to speak up and openly about it, too often we or others dismiss it as \"being overdramatic\"... but it's not. I hope talking it through also helps you heal from the experience and it gives you the strength to continue travelling (elsewhere) and feel safe and relaxed when you do.",
      "I think most of the blame of this disgusting behaviour should be placed on their movies and mainstream entertainment. From the beginning of Bollywood and other local film industries, the violence and rape against women has been glorified and it still continues. Movies and dramas have been the Indians' mainstay of entertainment and if you are being exposed to such scenes of travesties and abuse against women for a long period of time, the notion of it being a common occurrence will settle into their subconscious.",
      "I am feeling very sad right now, bad days are part of good experiences but this not acceptable at all....I was following your vlogs about Delhi etc but thought it was one off, can only feel happy right now that you are safe and back home. I would ask the respective state Govts (Tourism Dept) to provide extra safety at all Tourist spots.",
      "I never knew it was so bad. Women aren't allowed in the public sphere in some places not buecause necessarily that they're second class citizens not experiencing any sort of womens rights, but because the men who have women realise what other men do and how hungry they are for any sort of companionship/wan* bank material etc. So any woman is a free for all if they aren't properly escorted. It's a shame but just like an oasis in a dry desert they'll flock to you and the amount of time they've been hungry is looked at as reason enough to ignore normal social protocol. So going on your own is not a wise first choice especially if you don't look like the back end of a bus and you have your hair on show. The combination of testosterone, scarcity and heat makes men crave female attention even more as I'm sure you fully recognise now. My cousin used to have the same problem in Dubai with Indians even in front of their wives and children. When women are kept from the public sphere you have this problem.",
      "I grew up with these experiences. I live in NZ/Aussie now and still feel haunted by the past and can never travel solo as my friends tell me here. Which is normal as they grew up. I am sorry for your experience. Its quite saddening because apart from these incidents there is so much to see and experience there. You are quite brave to do another trip. Personally I wouldn't. I have dropped an email to a few people in govt. Not sure how far that will go. But we can only try. You did everything right there for your safety. And I do not like it when tourist give in to allow selfies. It really make no sense to get selfie with a stranger.",
      "I'm the last to try to talk anybody out of doing something but it's pattern sadly... How many times I heard that I cannot count. Literally everybody I talked to was stressing that if solo traveler - only men should do this. A female one - absolutely not under any circumstances...",
      "The only way a foreigner can visit India is when they have a regular Indian companion (not related to travel companies) who can be with them at all times. This country is just way too messed up, particularly touristy cites and when they see white people they only care about the money.  Even locals have to fight to avoid scams.\nAs an Indian I would strictly advice anyone to not come to India (or atleast these super populated touristy cities) unless they know a reputable local person.\n\nAlso regarding harassment, first of all I would never recommend a solo male/female tourist to visit India. And if you do and are a female, I would say not walk the streets alone and have a companion at all times.",
      "Phoebe so sorry that these men harassed you and made uncomfortable.  I would report this to tour company about your your experience that way the tour company and tell them that they will never use them again.  Phoebe I worked at U. S Embassy - may I make suggestion- next time you travel in a different foreign country let your country embassy know you are in that foreign country and ask them what part of the country is the safest and worst.  Again I am sorry that you had to through.  If you feel uncomfortable I would just leave. We want you and be on your travels.",
      "A an Indian male I feel so bad that these horrible things happened to you. Dont know what I would do if my wife had the same experiences while alone.",
      "*sorry my english bad*\nAs a Indian I am sorry, \nYes that's happened to lots of people We accept that India getting getting worst & worst day by day.\n\nI have one thing to ask travelers want to explore India its colourful culture thats right \nBut all travelers the traveled in triangle (see the map of india) place you also, do you know the difference between North & south india\nSearch in the YouTube \nIts like North & South Korea \nCompletely different \nI hope you understand \nI have a sister's I didn't send my sister's to North alone or even not for studying \nOnce again i am sorry to you as a Indian (* I don't like to be a Indian*)\nKarala, Tamil nadu, ex..., also top of the India lot's of good places",
      "Phoebe so sorry that these men harassed you and made uncomfortable.

      "I'm so sorry this is happening to you. Thank you for sharing.",
      "You are amazing for speaking out and making this video so everyone is aware.",
      "i hate that you went through this, phoebe!! I'm so angry for you. it's sounds terrifying and of course people can say \"it's just a photo\" but it's your sense of safety and security and personal space while visiting a foreign place. and the hotel room key stuff is horrifying. I got a door stop alarm off amazon, its SO loud but also jams the door and sits easy and small at the bottom of a backpack for travel. thank you for sharing this experience. it is so important to share these sides of travel. onto better days my friend, sending big hugs, love and strength!",
      "I’m so sorry you experienced such terrible treatment and thank you for sharing this video.. you are so brave! It sounds like you need to revisit Japan where things like this don’t seem to happen 💕",
      "Hi 🌱 what is your thoughts all men's bad in India and it's not only  happening in India everywhere in the world and they're are thinking white people's aliens or something special  I'm sorry say that but it is true",
      "Sorry to hear about your experience.. My girlfriend (white french) and I (korean american) traveled to india/pakistan last year. We did everything ourselves with no tour and only ate and hang around local places. Surprisingly we weren't harassed much. I think you are right. If you are a white female solo traveling, you will probably get harassed more. We did get approached everyday but they leave us after we tell them to f*ck off. We don't really blame the individual people harassing us but the shit system and education these people grew up with. Because to be honest we went to wealthy areas in new delhi and it was the exact opposite. people were very kind and no one was bothering you. No one staring, no one trying to sell you stuff. It just tells you the significant discrepancies in a population. I just hope things improve in india so that future tourists don't deal with such pain.\n\nI also heavily blame your tour guides. I can't believe they took you too areas where you would get harassed more. That is a terrible red flag...\n\nNext time, check out northern india like srinagar and ladakh! It is very beautiful and people are kind. And pakistan! We loved it there so much. Although parts of lahore and karachi you might face similar issue. \n\nThank you for sharing your experience and being honest! I think more people need to share their experience so they are prepared before going.",
      "Hi Phoebe, yes! this video is much needed.  This can motivate Indian to actually enforce rules against harassement, violence and rape.  It is not enough to just make rules. There exists a gang rape culture that must be exposed further for it to be changed.  Last march, a spanish blogger  couple was assaulted, she was raped.  4 guys were arrested in Jharkhand. I am very relieved no violence happened to you. please.  Please be careful, we wish to see you  make more travel content with your normally  bubbly cheerful character.",
      "Thank you for sharing your honest opinion Phoebe. As a solo traveler too this is very valuable information. Sorry to hear everything you had to go through, it is not ok 😢 These people had no right invading your personal space like this, you are strong girl, they are the problem!",
      "Sorry to hear about your travel experience in india. Had come across your channel while searching for things to do in sydney and singapore. People especially women will be more cautious when traveling to india.",
      "Oh my goodness, that is such an awful thing to happen.\nI did India as a solo female but went with a well known group tour.\nOur guide was fantastic but I stuck to him like glue as the 1 day I had on my own I felt very unsafe.\nThankfully we had about 15 in our group so we were never really alone during the tour.\nThe only reason I wanted to go India was to see the Taj Mahal but I ended up being pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed it.\nI have been solo travelling now for nearly 30 years and as female traveller we really have to be so aware and trust our gut.\nThank you for sharing your experience with us, it could ultimately save someone 😊",
      "Good video Phoebe. Better be safe than sorry. And thank you for mentioning that Kerala was relatively safe.",
      "Go back to china,Great wall,Hangzhou city,Avantar moutain... and the safest country on the plane,wellcome back to china again,China has changed so so much.",
      "I am so sorry you went through this -No one should have to. I have been to Goa ( a long time ago) and went to karela on my own. I am a bit shocked with these 2 places I hope you’re feeling ok.",
      "India is a place with an amazing culture and rich religious traditions. However, when it comes to women, there are significant issues with behaviour and respect. Some people believe they can apply force on women and act as they please. I hope the tourism ministers of each state in India are watching these videos. Until the mindset of the people changes, foreigners should consider staying away from visiting India unless you are going as a part of a large group. As someone born, raised, and who lived in India for 22 years, I am appalled and ashamed. Sorry, Phoebe, your courage to complete the journey truly deserves a lot of credit.❤",
      "I love travelling but India and Egypt are two countries I'd never visit. Have heard of too many horror stories, like yours and some where the women never come home. I'm sorry this happened to you. Take care of yourself",
      "I am indian odisha bhadrak District joy jaganath mam I love my india bharat mata kii joy joy shree ram mam❤❤❤🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🚩🚩🚩🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻",
      "My gender can be absolute (cant say the words I want to cos YT will filter them out) sometimes. \nPhoebe this video was so brave of you to do and anyone could how emotional you were doing it.  Im sure its helped a lot of people and I hope you found it maybe a bit cathartic to do. \nPlease take care, your videos bring a lot of joy to so many, dont forget that.",
      "There are many things to be ashamed of being an Indian. You just narrated one of them. Every time I see any of my kind approaches a foreigner for a selfie it just boils my blood. These men make my country a shithole that it is.",
      "How horrific! That would have been so scary. I'm glad you shared your experience.",
      "Never Travel India as Solo Women ....India is very beautiful amazing country  but need precaution as Women Travelers .....\n\nBetter to Come India  with family  or in Group ...Do better research in advance about Hotel Restaurants...Cab \n\nFeel very sorry as Indian about your bad experiences in India .You go with Bad memories of my country  ...Mostly it happens  because of you are alone foreign women  travel  India ...... Infact  if any Indian women travel solo in India ...they also face more or less similar Problems \n\nPeople mostly like take photos  with foreigners in India but tourist can politely  say no ...that is best strategy\n\nWish that you come India in future ....and have best memories of Travel Life Here",
      "Hi Phoebe! This vlog really got me.What you experienced is simply horryfying!I felt your anger,your candid talk about male harrassment.And i picture you in that hotelroom for 3 days,scared to death.India is a man dominated society.So thank God,nothing serious happened to you.But you have my support,try to pamper yourself with good coffee and close friends.THanks so much for your courage!",
      "Sorry for your experience nobody should ever feel that way when traveling. With that said I still don’t understand why anybody especially women think it’s a good idea to travel India. Do your research learn experiences from other women that have travelled there you get about the same stories of harassment…. Basically signed up for what you’re in the knowing of. Scamming and harassment is in the men’s blood over there!",
      "Oh wow, your experience is almost play by play the same to Tavelight (another YouTuber) about 5 years ago.  I can't find the video now but she also barricaded herself in her room and men tried to get in, because she had the lights off and she said she could see the light from the corridor making shadows under the door, she could see men lingering outside at night.\n\nI have never been to India, and I am a man.  I wouldn't go there out of principle to support their tourism.  I am really sorry to hear you had this ordeal, nobody should have to feel unsafe, especially when the company you paid for is meant to look after you.",
      "Hi Phoebe! It sounds like you had an awful experience...thats sad to hear but i think the agency you hired deserves a lot of blame as instead of highlighting the himalayan tourist destinations (more than 10k hill stations) they took you to the big cities and made you stay at avg hotels for kickback... The north india is economically backward region of india and often tourists visit those places which even the domestic tourists avoid...Places in the south, east and himalayas are the ideal tourist destinations in india but agencies wont plan a tour there as there are not much chances of kickback...the Himalayas are devoid of any people, clean and free of any pollution hence are the ideal places for tourism. If you look at the vlogs of Sikkim, Leh, Dharamshala you would understand what I am trying to say as i feel those are the places you should have visited instead of the chaotic cities...",
      "Glad you said what you needed to say. Why should you feel bad narrating your experience?\n\nIts important these things are said out loud, because it can help other (female travelers) decide.",
      "BOOKING MISTAKES.  Who did you book your trip with?  Definitely not a reputable company with reputable hotels.  If you are a solo female traveler, always go with name brands.   This applies to most of the world.  Go with big name hotels, big name tour company.  It will not be that expensive in India.",
      "India is really a tough place to be for western solo traveler, its really unfortunate what happened to you. I Had a similar experience during Holi festival a couple of yrs back and I was with my fiancé’ during those times..I’m glad you made it out in one piece Phoebe..",
      "I suggest you to visit ladakh Leh, kashmir, Shimla, Manali, Rishikesh, udaipur, jodhpur, Jaisalmer, pushkar, Goa, Kerala, Bangalore, hampi, meghalaya, Darjeeling, Sikkim, Andaman and Nicobar islands in India 🇮🇳❤️",
      "Traveling India is that safe like traveling any Europe's country OR US today. Not surprice, not special! You walk on street in Europe's any country OR US's, randomly some homeless guy stabbed you in back or Vulgar comment faceing if you're a lady. So, Whole world including India in same Boat. Only difference is What Sewage western world penetrated in South East especially in India, Today same thing their generation facing on the streets of their country. That is \" illegal immigrants\".",
      "Really sad to hear this unpleasant and terrible experience. But it's not an anomaly unfortunately.  Hope you recover well from the trip. \n\nMy experiences as a native Indian: (note: The average north indian is the most hospitable person you can get and are really friendly and helpful. So not dissing the average person. I may not be the most adventurous person)\n\nThe rest of India is simply more calm and far less overwhelming than the North. The cities are less populated than the north. The ppl are a lot less aggressive and pushy. The scams are lesser than the north (not zero. There's a lot here too. Just lesser). This is something my north indian peers say too. \n\nOur family's personal experience in Rajasthan: \nWe stayed at reputed 4 star hotels throughout the trip. The staff at the hotels were very good. The forts are epic. The Udaipur cruise was awesome. The Rajasthani food is good. \n\nThe problems: We Indians know the art of bargaining and knowing when to spot scams like Pashmina etc etc. We know that tourism guys like cab drivers can be pushy. But even for us it was getting overwhelming. \n\nWe hired a driver via the hotel from Jodhpur to Jaipur. He was nice at first, but highly aggressive later. He wasn't listening to our parents request to drive calmly. His conduct at petrol stations was shady as heck. We were relieved when we reached Jaipur. The agency associated with the Jodhpur hotel that gave the driver apologized and gave us other drivers for Jaipur. The hotel was wonderful. But the first Jaipur driver was highly pushy. He wasn't wanting us to go to Bapu Bazaar which is a beautiful Bazaar. He was pushing us to go to a mall which we weren't interested. We had to be assertive. \n\nThe 2nd driver wasn't pushy but he was unfriendly. \n\nAt Udaipur, the drivers were quite aggressive. This sullied our trip there a bit. It gave a bitter taste. The mistake we made: hiring drivers at the airport in Udaipur, and continuing with the agency from Jodhpur. \n\nMy tips when visiting India: \n\nStay at reputed hotel chains like Taj, Ibis, Fortune etc. Don't go to unknown hotels. \n\nUse guides/drivers from the hotels. Don't use unknown agencies. Even though they maybe more expensive, it helps\n\nDo thorough research. Put your foot down when the driver doesn't want to take you to places you want to visit. Don't let the drivers  dictate how the trip should go. Inform the hotels if you feel uncomfortable. \n\nDon't fall for scams. If you want to do shopping, shop at places you've researched and feel comfortable. \n\nDon't indulge in too many conversations outside of the travel related stuff. It can easily get dicey. \n\nDon't allow auto/cab guys to bring others into the vehicle. \n\nBe vigilant throughout the journey. Observe the drivers conduct. Walk out if unsafe after pending money settlements. \n\nKeep cash. It helps. Also keep food poisoning medicines ready.",
      "Oh noPhoebe how absolutely horrifying and appalling 🥺\nI said it all in your video a few weeks back. \nI’m so sorry you had to experience this, take care of yourself 😢😔",
      "Hi @travelforphoebe ,\n\nA long time subscriber of your videos …. \n\nI enjoyed every bit of Indian vlog … I am so happy you were able to explore India … being from foreign land. \n\nI feel sorry you took back such bad nuggets of experience with you. \n\nSomehow India is still living in Stone Age when it comes to Travel experiences locally. \n\nYou are a brave heart …. ♥️ All the love . Don’t shy away ….\n\nIndia is a such a big mix bag …. If you do your research and try to come back again….\n\nActually everywhere everyone gets to have different experiences when it comes to race/ gender / ethnicity and every country has variety of different reactions . \n\nBut yes …. India is one of those Asian countries behind … Where travel experiences are still growing  …. Specially after Singapore , Bali , Thailand …..",
      "I didnt care about photos went n s e and w except deserted places alone and found no issues..dirty often yea but people were generous and kind.  ❤❤",
      "As an Indian Aussie, its this gross behaviour like this that gives us a bad rep all over the world. People should feel safe from all this crap no matter where you are in the world.",
      "As an Indian,  apologies , u just experienced a nightmare,  yes it sometimes gets. Tricky with men in certain parts of country but believe me such cases are very less , I am sad that that  u had such a horrific expereince in my country,  believe me India isn't all about such expereince,  hope to see u in Mumbai and India Again to enhance ur expereince. 🎉",
      "Oh my goodness you poor thing! That’s awful. What disgusting behaviour and how scary for you. I’m so sorry you were and still are dealing with this. I would have been terrified too. I think you are doing the right thing sharing that side with viewers.  Sending much love and peace your way 🩷",
      "That is some greasy behaviour. To think what some of these creeps can do with a photo with some of that deep fake stuff is simply awful. I can't imagine how scary that would have been. I once saw a scene from a Bollywood film being shot (in Lyon of all places). It involved a pretty woman on a bicycle being pursued by a number of men. Everyone smiling. Hearing your story it just seems so wrong. I hope all your travels are happy from now on.",
      "Oh I am so sorry you had to go through this and it sounds horrible. I think I would have been on the first plane I can get out of there. Thanks for sharing at least now I know its not somewhere I will ever visit.",
      "Safest places for women to travel solo in india?! Dress casual? \n1)northeast india(women even camp and hitchhike there solo)\n2)kerala(gods own country) and remaining part of south india to some extent banglore hyd etc \nRest are safe if u take prepare and do ur due diligence ..\nMany places like bihar  and chattisgargh u wont wanna be be unless u know someone or has company .even then u need to dress accordingly \n....dont visit golden quad if possible ..i repeat again and again ..ul either be harrassed , scammed or ur impression of india scarred",
      "I recommend visiting  kerala ..also called gods own country ...safe for solo women travellers , one of the 100 must visit places before u die by national geography. Educated well behaved local populace ...many many videos by solo female travellers online u can get reference too ..india gets so much hate bcz of how these north indians treat solo women ...please dont judge our entire country based on a strip of land thats called the dirtiest strip of india by indians thats used to dupe foreigners",
      "Golden triangle is the dirtiest ,crowded and overpopulated and creepiest zone in india ..its the place good value  indians tourist  avoid most ..if u know what i mean ...its the stereotyped india .the sepia overtones.dirty roads , plastics , creepy men , honking cars...south india like kerala ,northeast india and north himalyan areas of shimla , gulmarg , leh ladakh etc are the places to be .."
