      "I have been outside of India for past 20 years in UK, Hong Kong and China - ofcourse I go back to Gurugram , Kolkata etc where I have family and home- I have been to USA at least 60 times and lived there for 3 years - I saw your Vlog with some positive expectations but with due respect, guys don’t come out of USA if you don’t know how to appreciate different cultures- India is different but still refreshingly international especially Gurugram ! Yes , don’t expect Beef in McDonald and make faces just like we don’t get potato burger 🍔 in USA McDonald - all I saw in your vlog was shopping mall and hotel - really !!! That’s how you plan to visit any city of a country and share your expert views of that country and culture ! Do us a favor pls - don’t come to India and don’t say you love India to get views and earn dollar because we are 1.4 billion and that help you financially! Thanks",

      "What exactly is the point to go to India and look for food that is available in the US.",
      "Please stop apologising to foreigners for every little thing YOU may be ashamed of. All you're doing is feeding ethnocentricity. Things like police checks and poverty are found in every country in the world. THEY are coming HERE. If you're visiting a country it's common sense to do some research and educate yourself about what to expect. Don't just land there like a noob and act astonished by something you didn't expect. As it is, the very fact that they visited the Taj eyesore (it's a friggin' mausoleum for god's sakes) they're behaving like any other tourist rich or poor.",
      "Everything is culture shock for these assholes 😂 even they piss on public with long night parties, this is nothing. Just travel Las vegas.",

      "Please don't keep expectations of U.S. while travelling in Asia except for a few Asian countries like maybe China, Singapore... You will get diverse culture, experiences in Asia especially in India which is a very big country. India is not just Delhi, Gurugram, Agra. You will find both calm pleasant places & chaotic places in India. You need to do your research on different places of India where you can travel maybe thru ChatGPT or Grok. Avoid road side food which you visually find unhygienic since you need a strong stomach for that but otherwise there are many good restaurants where you can try out the different Indian delicacies. You can always ask the waiter to reduce or cut out the spice in the food if you are not ok with it. A good hack to neutralise spice in a dish is to add yogurt/curd to it. So you can always ask the restaurant to give you a bowl/pack of yogurt/curd to be safe. \n\nI'm surprised that you didn't have Rajasthan in your itinerary.",

      "Culture shock is inevitable if you are a westerner going east or vice versa. But so long as you are expecting it, and are okay with it, so long as it is a pleasant surprise, it's fine. If you are expecting the culture shock, you will enjoy it, however queer it may seem to you. But if you don't enjoy the culture shock, it means you were not expecting it. And that means, wherever you go, you do not expect, wish or want any change in your daily routine of food, way of life, or other standards. In that case, why change your daily routine at all? Why take the trip? Best stay at home.",

      "British rule in the Indian subcontinent, affected social development, public infrastructure, and perceptions of “civility.”\nIt’s true that before colonial rule, the subcontinent had highly developed urban planning and hygiene systems in many periods of history — for example:\n\n\nThe Indus Valley Civilization (Harappa and Mohenjo-daro) had advanced drainage systems and public baths over 4,000 years ago.\n\n\nAncient and medieval Indian cities often emphasized water management, waste disposal, and sanitation, with sophisticated tank and canal systems.\n\n\nWhen the British colonized India, their policies prioritized resource extraction and trade advantages for Britain rather than the welfare of local populations. Infrastructure was often designed to serve British administrative and commercial interests (like railways for moving raw materials), not local health or sanitation. By the time they left in 1947, much of the subcontinent’s economy and infrastructure had been reoriented around colonial needs — and many indigenous systems of civic management and education had deteriorated or been replaced.\nThe notion that “Europe is civilized” and colonized peoples are not was itself part of the colonial narrative — a way to justify imperial rule. Modern historians increasingly challenge that idea, recognizing that the British Empire left deep social and economic scars while appropriating local knowledge and wealth.",
      "11:34 Even as indian we want to get rid of these idiots from our society but the problem is, before entire india get some civic sense bollywood normalised objectification of women in movies, songs, item numbers etc. so now there are two type of indians in India, one who hates bollywood to ruin our society and other who is blindly following everything bollywood teaching them.",

      "Индия — это не просто страна, это цивилизация, процветающая уже более 5000 лет. Мы — земля Вед, йоги и учения Махатмы Ганди, где идея «Васудхайва Кутумбакам» — мир — одна семья — направляла наше мировоззрение. Наша культура ценит разнообразие; у нас более 22 официальных языков, сотни диалектов, и каждая религия мира находит здесь своё место. Мы известны такими праздниками, как Дивали и Холи, которые символизируют победу света над тьмой и единство в многообразии. Индийская кухня богата и разнообразна, полна специй и вкусов, которые рассказывают историю нашей земли. Хотя мы признаём, что Индия сталкивается с такими проблемами, как бедность и проблемы с чистотой, мы — страна, постоянно растущая и совершенствующаяся. Мы добились выдающихся успехов в науке, технологиях, исследовании космоса и медицине — от первой попытки отправки миссии на Марс до мирового лидерства в сфере ИТ-услуг. Индийцы радушны, гостеприимны и уважительны к гостям, часто повторяя «Атити Дево Бхава» – «Гость – Бог». Мы верим в мир, но сильны в защите своего народа и своих ценностей. Индия – это страна, где древние традиции и современный прогресс идут рука об руку, и каждый гость уезжает с частичкой своей души в сердце.",

They were easily distinguishable in between the local Whites and Blacks, bcs they looked different. \nAnd they had to arrange bombs and guns inside the USA/Europe. Muslim population in USA is very less, so they had limited local jihadi support. But, still they succeeded several times. And the whole NATO came to fight them, with Trillions of Dollars and lives of young soldiers spent on it. But, still no conclusive victory and had to leave, after getting tired with it. Outcome of 20 yrs war....after 20 yrs., USA accepted return of the same Terrorist institution, which NATO came to destroy.\n\nNow, look at Indian's bravado. India is within walking distance of Terroristan Pakistan. Being the toughest terrain in world, thousands of miles of the border are unsecured. Undistinguishable physical or facial structure.....India holds 2nd largest muslim population in the world, which means Huge local support to the terrorists.

There r lot of pervs all around as u have experienced within the one of the most expensive hotel where people were filming & watching yall from their room windows as u were sun bathing in bikinis. If u want beef , go to Northeast states like Mizoram, Nagaland, Manipur, don't know if beef is easily available in Assam. You can get beef in Kolkata, Hyderabad & many places in Kerala & may be in Goa as well. But you may not get beef sandwiches at all anywhere in India & it sounds crazy. You will find beef curries & other items made from beef in the cities or states that I have named above. You may or may not find cooked Bacon at all in any burgers but I did find a shop in New Delhi which had raw Bacons & pork available but I didn't buy them as I was only visiting New Delhi & I didn't have the means to cook. I think beef is available in some areas in New Delhi but it could be buffalo or bull (Ox) meat but not cow. Cow beef is a serious issue in this country & it's just INSANE.\n\nI did travel in New Delhi wearing short boxers & I didn't face any issues but there are certain places around India where entry are restricted if you are wearing shorts or half pants. I have experienced it myself & was surprised too by such weirdness.  Summers are extreme in parts of northern states (except Jammu & Kashmir) & southern states.",

I wear them myself, even there's small stares here and there, most people are pretty much used to it. And plz don't be afraid of calling people out strenly when you're uncomfortable or feel unsafe. And as for bikinis, we mostly don't wear them in public beaches, but private pools and hotels and resorts are a different thing. There's a place Goa that's a popular tourist spot in India, and people there wear bikins and stuff to the beaches, just to let you know. Anyways have fun throughout the rest of your trip! ❤",

They will behave very friendly with you and do everything to gain your trust, but later they'll start doing everything typical of many Indians—like promoting casteism, making you worship the dead, supporting the dowry system, practicing black magic, lying, and even encouraging sacrifices, including animals, humans, and children. They will teach you to believe in imaginary things that don’t even exist.

      "I'm just warning you Kelly you should do a survey in India first and don't just go to India and it's a big mistake to go there, you don't know how dangerous India is, the In case of rape, when they go after a foreign woman, especially a white woman, they rarely see a white foreign woman, you never know when your back is turned, they will secretly follow you And if Where you are staying in India, they plan to rape you and get you pregnant by an Indian rapist, you don't know they can pretend to the foreigner that you are their girl friend but They plan to try to rape you and because you are white and they have a high case in their country which is reaching the number one case of rape among foreigners of different races white Indians have raped And it turns out that their case in India reaches 500,000 plus crimes, probably before you can leave the country of India you will be raped by an Indian who is a jerk!  Because I first researched in India whether it is safe or not to go there, that is true, it is not safe for foreign women who are white or Asian to go to India, because they will touch foreign And it's supposed to be friendly but they don't have a plan in their mind to rape the foreigner who is white or Asian and they intend to do that at the right time for you, I surveyed India which is not safe in YouTube and Google make India unsafe for foreigners who are white or Asian,\"!! ☝️Real talk only! Don't just trust what the Indian says and they can follow you or take you to another place that they know you don't know that you are dangerous that they will rape you and shoot Inside your pussy!!!",

      "Kkwabegi one of my favourite Korean Street food..i never tried but Indian blogger said that it's very good and it's taste like mathura cake in India...and in West Bengal Mathura cake find 1times in a year during durgapuja festival.. don't know about other states mathura cake available or not ..but in West Bengal we find one time in a year..so if I visit South Korea i daily eat kkwabegi",
      "I genuinely, for the love of god, do not understand the mindset of foreigners in india. \n\nTrust me she's very excellent as a person, she's very energetic but i can't understand what she's trying to do in india. \n\nIf she's on tour she hasn't even visited one single tourist spot. If she wants to try various food she hasn't even tried 1% of indian food. ( street food isn't really what you should eat very often as a foreigner. You're not used to it and might get sick)\n\nWhy would someone willingly want to go to some backwater local marketplace which is crowded as hell and genuinely too overwhelming for a foreigneer. Because people are not used to people looking like her and they will all gawk you in curiosity. Even as an indian i have going to crowded marketplaces so i go to malls. I just don't get it what she's trying to do. The whole video she just went around a super crowded market saying namaste to everyone. That's not really the best way to interact with locals if you want that. You could go to coffe shops and go to modern area you can talk to people who can actually communicate properly with you in silence.\n\nAgain, i really don't know what she's trying to do but this is a bad receipt for disaster what she's currently doing. She should not roam around at backwater market areas. Come on, you have such good money advantage as a foreigner! India isn't only crowded and rural! There is soo so much you can see and do but foreigners only want to be around slumy areas and then unfortunately something bad happens to them ( remember foreigners are more vulnerable for certain people to target, this is for any country)\n\nWould you want to go in a area of USA known for having drug addicts and gunmen? Absolutely not. Same logic applies in india. Visit nature spots, historical spots, modern cities, villages ( if you're into that ). You're just wasting so much potential its painful to watch. \n\nFinally, I'm only saying all this because I'm concerned for you please don't take it in any wrong way.",

      "The Ganges River, sacred to Hindus, is considered the most polluted river in the world. Second place is Indonesian Citarum – its lead content is over 1,000 times higher than the US Environmental Protection Agency standard for drinking water. Water from the Ganges has been linked to dysentery, cholera, hepatitis, and severe diarrhea, which remains one of the leading causes of death among children in India.  But pollution, dams and removal of too much water (mostly for agriculture) have affected the flow and health of this vital river. One of the river's most at-risk animals is the Ganges river dolphin. The Ganga today is facing formidable pollution pressures, along with the attendant threats to its biodiversity and environmental sustainability.",

      "One doesn't need to be a \"Hindu\" to attain Moksha as we say it. It's the karma of every person which is the key deciding factor which either helps in attaining moksha or keep stuck in birth, death and then again rebirth, rinse & repeat cycle. Original faith is called Sanatan Dharma and Hinduism is generally speaking considered oldest sub -branch of Sanatan Dharma, other sub-branches are known as Budhism, Jainism and Sikhism to say the least, just like Abrahmic religions tree. As I said earlier, one doesn't need to be \"Hindu\" to attain Moksha. You just need to be doing what's best for humanity and nature, and eventually your goods deeds will earn the path to salvation, nothing else nothing more.",

      "Guys,\n1. Ganga originates from Himalayas. You can keep the water in a bottle and even after 10 years you won't find a worm in it\n2. The mighty Ganga equates to spiritual knowledge. Ganga is ancient. Hence Ganga is placed on the head of Shiva as he releases that knowledge in small porportions as it's not possible for normal humans to consume it (not easy)\n3. Ganga is place where holymen visit. So many find their gurus their (used to be) where they can relieve themselves from the worldly bondage through the knowledge of higher reality\n4. There are places called Chathrams(not sure what it's in North or locally but i used a south Indian word) . People from all over India who aim to die in Varanasi would go there and live in these Chatrams which are free places of stay. They die in Varanasi or Kashi as it's called",

      "Varanasi is one of the oldest City' in the world. Some people nd google(not credible always) say a city in Israel is Oldest but not exactly. Don't get me wrong I'm not hurting anyone,but telling truth. Sanatan is very scientific,why people want to bath and Stored Ganga water there is a reason, Every river water fouls after few day storage but Not Ganga water bcz of its medicinal properties from which it's coming from Himalayas. And This Big city of Varanasi is very very old so that it's street is very narrow. I'm just Giving more information so take it as It is. When Europe was struggling for Food and for food they used to Use Stone and k!ll animal that time Bharat ( india) was much much Civilized and well established. Also u can go through history that before invasion of foreign invader what was the Literacy and Wealth, let me tell u Upto 17th century India was Most richest Country in the world and holding of 25% of World gdp. Development is not only about tall buildings nd money but it's culture and beautiful diversity. And From the past thousand yr Many tried to do cultural genocide bt still the oldest civilization alive now , if u see Egyptian or greek they all vanished and Sanatan ideology and Hindu still Prospering.\nGuys i like ur video ,and the way u both beautiful couples enjoying trip in india . Keep it up❤️❤️❤️❤️",

      "Hindu is not a religion. the land between Himalayas and Indu Sagar ie indian oceean called Hindustan and people who lived between this land called hindu. so it was the regional identity originally, then it became more of a cultural identity. the name hindu was given by the foreign invaders. there is no religious book in Hinduism also there is no one God. other cultures believe that God made them in india people make gods. people in india have the liberty to worship or not to worship at all. stone  book  animals plants everything and anything can be worshipped in this culture one can even worship himself or herself, whatever means a lot to him or her. this is the only culture which is built on spirituality not faith. it is the birth place of spirituality which completely opposite of faith . although in competition to others they are trying to build a religion in Hinduism but there they will never succeed. if you go to someone's home in ind you would see them worshipping several gods so even they are not sure the which is The God. that's the basis of any religion that there has to be one God one book and all must follow it without questioning. that would never happen in Indian culture . in Bhagavad Gita which is claimed by many that it is a religious book is full of questions to krishna from arjuna. that would never happen in a religion only in spirituality it happens. even the Vedas (veda means knowledge) are books of wisdom not religion. Hinduism not about God and what God commanded, the first book of veda \"rigveda \" questioned the God existence in one hymn that is God really made us? The universe? Then another hymn says universe created by vibration than 5 elements came = space, force, heat, soil, water then life was created by itself according to rigveda.",

      "Kashi is a very very old historic city in India. It was originally designed to have consecrated temples to replicate the human energy system(nadis, chakras), so that the city behaves like a living organism to benefit people in their spiritual process.\nExplanation for the reason why Hindus burn the dead body along with throwing the ashes in a river - Human body is made of different layers like physical, mental, energetic structures along with the soul(non physical part of our being). When a person dies, physical and mental structure disappears but the soul stays on and tries to find another womb. After death, the energetic structure takes a few days to completely leave the being(that is why you see some processes like fingernails growing even for the dead body). If the dead body is not burned, some occult and black magic people can utilize this energy and cause pain to the being. The ashes can also be misused, so they disperse it in a flowing river.",
      "Hindus worship nature, rivers plants animals.  \nFor example, one of the reasons why Ganga is worshipped if you look at it from pragmatic point of veiw the river irrigates the massive Gangetic doab region, and makes the soil fertile. Directly or indirectly, 200M people are dependent on its sacred waters for their livelihoods. Without it life would be really difficult in Gangatic planes. \nHindus worship banyan tree because of it emiting the outsized amount of oxygen.  Hindus worship Basil tree, for its medicinal purposes, or sun for its importance in role for the sustainance of life so on and on.  Its our way of giving thanks to the nature so on and on.",
