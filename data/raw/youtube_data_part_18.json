JFYI Darjeeling is a promised land for Nepali speaking Indians (Bharatiya Gorkhali) and is under dispute for 200 years now, it is only governed by west Bengal until it becomes a state. It's very shameful when someone asks me which state I hail from, I tell people I am from Darjeeling, West Bengal, the very next thing they say is oh! you're a bengali?\nPeople have to go through this identity crisis daily. I hope someday we get out statehood as promised by the govt and we Bharatiya gorkhali can proudly say i am from Gorkhaland, India.",

But brother i would like to let you know that Darjeeling and other hills people do not speak Nepali just because it is located near Nepal border. But it is our mother tongue. Most of our culture may match with Nepalese from Nepal but all our ancestors are from India and not from Nepal. In such a way, Bengali people are from Bangladesh but bengali people are also found in West Bengal whose ancestors may have never been to Bangladesh and their cultures are common too. Good work overall  :)",

      "One of the best video documentaries ever on our beautiful Darjeeling. It is an amazing experience to experience Darjeeling in reality but this video captures those details and angles kudos to the drone shots, that one can’t experience in person. The writing, concept, narration, shooting, angles, colouring, video editing and most importantly choice of apt background music, makes this videography and production simply top notch. Every second of this video left me mesmerised and in awe and at the end when the music faded away it left a very fulfilling feeling of nostalgia. \nI visited Darjeeling including a lot of these places shown in this video, merely 6 months back, yet it feels like ages and makes me want to visit again as soon as possible. Till then I keep revisiting this video.\nKeep producing such beautiful videos! Will look forward to your future content, and hopefully there will be a part two of the Darjeeling series again in near future. Maybe you can venture out to the adjacent places which are equally enticing as Darjeeling, like Risheehat, Gopaldhara, Takdah, Tinchuley, Tukvar, and so many others, all within the Darjeeling district.",

The native of Darjeeling are still Nepalese origin. You guys won’t find this information much clearly in google because most of the history articles are written by India based websites which are not 100% correct. Why don’t the creator and the Indians(who knows the real history) tell the history properly are you guys ashamed of accepting that British government invaded Nepal and left India back some of the beautiful territories in the world? 9:25 even some peaks of Kanchenjunga is in India because of East-India company.",

I just returned from a 16 day trip to Amsterdam, London and Brussels. In UK for most of the attractions like London Eye, Buckingham Palace, Tower of London etc, at least a night before I booked the tickets online to avoid  last minute sell outs and lines. May be you are not so serious about visiting the Castle inside I guess and prepared either way. Cheers \n👏",
