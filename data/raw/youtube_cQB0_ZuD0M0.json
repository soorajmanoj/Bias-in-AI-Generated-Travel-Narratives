        "What did you find interesting in this video?\nThe journey continues in this video https://youtu.be/LNgp16FXtcc\n*Disclaimer:* This video is a personal travel documentary and does not take a political stance on the Kashmir dispute. My focus is to share the beauty, culture, and experiences of this unique region with those who may not have the opportunity to visit. Please note that my content is in no way sponsored or influenced by any political or corporate entity. The names and terms used for these regions in the film are for ease of communication with the audience and do not imply any political affiliation or endorsement.\n*Clarification:* Since India's political map update in 2019, this region is now officially referred to in India as Ladakh. However, it is still commonly known in India as Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK).",

Looks super similar to Colorado in the US, which I have yet to visit as well. But honestly, you’re demystifying a lot of notions about traveling in that part of the world ( 🇵🇰 🇮🇳). Everybody’s super nice, there seems to be no petty crime, the food is delicious, and everyone’s hospitality to visitors is out of this world!

        "breath taking and beautiful! Gilgit is disputed land and so is Kashmir. Both are under the Un resolution awaiting referendum. But looks like Pakistan maintains high security to safeguard locals n tourists, unlike the neighbor. People are people, its only love. People stare because there is very little in their space. Some commented about the religious school, but probably that is all that they have, the state is bankrupt to run schools and children drop out of schools at high rate in this state. So dont be quick to point finger but read more to know more. School offers discipline to young mind; be conventional or of a religious designation. Lets be kind to each other especially children.  Hunza people are healthiest in this world. I am  glad Pakistan has taken good care of the region. nothing industrial built, topography maintained and people look to be at peace.People are commenting about kids marketing the kalma.... at least there are no violent mobs like happens in india where they force minority to say Jai Shree ram.yogi is setting up  up summer hindu schools, how does that sound? perspectives!",

We don't fight with anyone but they are the one always bring the issue and fight. British made like that and enjoyed seeing both the counties fighting. Same with Israel and Palestine British did that as well.",
        "Hey it is funny, Check out Sunny Yadav bike rider, they allowed him with his bike to go to Pakistan from india and he went in there Pakistanis stopped him and sent back because of the war still happening with Pakistan and india . But you could not even enter Pakistan side.",

        "1:25:28 main problem with them....look how brainwashed this kids are",
        "1:25:30 When that kid asked Karl if he could recite the Kalma, it reminded me of the Pahalgam attack. I know the child meant no harm, but moments like that reflect how deeply religion is embedded in everyday life. I believe that if Pakistanis get the opportunity, they should explore the world beyond their borders. Religion is important—it offers guidance and meaning—but it shouldn't define everything about a person or a society. And that's a major issue in Pakistan.",

With regular mob lynchings of its minorities, demonising of Sikh farmers and sexual violence against women and female infanticide. India is pulling another false flag operation - what has India got to hide, by not welcoming an independent investigation into the so called terrorist attack of Pahlagam. This is quite telling. Also sad to see all the RSS bots in the comments of this travel video, but not surprised. Islamophic talking points won't get you far, unless India acknowledges the rot within, it shall continue to be the Sick Man of Asia.",

And I see also that you had in more than ocassion an advantage form having an wife from the area, even if she wasnt around at some borders or controls, you are easier accepted when they find out. But your Honda ... can it be that it didnt like water spray? If there is dust all over the ignition system and that gets moist that can be an issue ... and dirty fuel. Cleaning a sparkplug is a joke in a 4 stroke. That is a relict from old 2 stroke days, which could choke from the oil in the fuel. But 4 stroke should not do that, only if the gap is wrong, or the ignition out of timing, or just moisture in the ignition system. The last one can happen even to modern cars. Move on, I look for more videos. Safe journey.",

        "Saying that there is love between common people and hatred between India and  Pakistan is only due to politics, is a misstatement.  You just noticed jalsa on the road, probably against a Muslim sect.  This might have turned bloody soon. This would have been the fate of Hindus daily in undivided  India. Hindus were killed in millions and driven out of their land from these areas during partition of India. You may say that Muslims also driven out from  India. But in all over India including  Haryana Punjab, and Delhi a huge number of Muslims still live and practice their religion and terrorize Hindus. While in Pakistan you will rarely find any Hindus. So please stop making comparisons and misleading Hindus into believing that it is all peaceful in Islam and people can live in peace together. Yes,  culture and language are the same but not the religion. This religion has a Semitic origin and belief system which are alien to the Indian subcontinent.",
