      "heia!\nwhy you recommend not to solo travel as a female? (especially if you've never done it yourself?)\nbefore i went to india, i was hearing/reading stuff like that sooo many times, which made me nervous. but in the end i realized, it's no problem (i was solo travelling from south to north for 2 months)\nof course use common sense.. but this applies for wherever you are in the world.\ni just think, it's a bit unfair for the representation of india, it's very cliche and not true (from my experience)\njust wanted to say that, cause i would have been glad, to read something like that before i went.",

Many tourists from these countries are hopping from monument to monument with smart English-speaking guides.\nTourists from Russia are only interested in Goa, this is because they look for places with warm climate, warm waters, affordability, easy availability of alcohol and relaxed dress codes. Goa seems to fulfill those categories.\nTourists from Israel, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Malayasia are interested in visiting Shimla, Manali and Dharmasala. Some have even travelled to Gulmarg and Pahalgam. This is because these places have cold weather and are the cheapest places for them to experience snowfall.\nStudents from Iraq, Iran and African countries visit Pune and Bangalore.\nFinally Bangladeshi tourists are only interested in shopping malls of Kolkata and in drinking.",

      "1) Best transportation to use in India is metro. India has the 8th largest metro system in the world. Currently, metro operates in 15 major cities of India.\n2) Except Uber, India also has Ola app for travelling.\n3) Indian people don't depend on using cards or atm much as we have unified payment interface (UPI) system which allows us to pay/transfer money directly through the mobile.\n4) India is very safe, just avoid going to shady places, cheap hotels and avoid Old Delhi type of places at all cost.\n5) India's food is very rich with spices and street foods are made with loads of spices which a foreigner's stomach is not used to. I would suggest to avoid street food as much as possible. Better to go to hotels and restaurants.",
      "Delhi belly and traffic is a bad combo.",
      "2023 ushers travel to India 🙏Thank you for your delightful videos Jeff 😁Blessings and continue your travel journey 🥂🍹",

      "South is way better than North.",
      "Watch out, you shouldn't eat street food even if its steaming hot, They could of used gutter oil for cooking. Its extremely toxic and full of carcinogens.",
      "Don't you mean the South being vegetarian vs North being non vegetarian?  Udipi style cuisine, in the South, is pure vegetarian...look for a town named Udipi/Udupi.  That's my heritage...what my parents grew up eating...and I like. It's part of me. North is more of Mughlai meat curries. Mumbai is seafood baby...all the way!!!...not to mention Parsi style also....Parsi as in Freddie Mercury (Farokh Bulsara) and Parsi. Goa is very heavily Portuguese influence in food and in religion and architecture. \n\nAlso the trains are what made India.  Maybe it's because my tata (grandfather) was a railway inspector on Western Railways in Mumbai, along with many Uncles working in the railways. \n\nAdditionally, you glanced right over the Deccan and Bangalore, Mysore, Coimbatore, and Ooty. Maybe for me, it's because of family. Bangalore is the third city that makes up the economic \"locomotive\" of India. Bangalore reminds my of California at the elevation of Denver. While Bangalore is a bit overbuilt, Mysore is beautiful...if you like palaces, yoga retreats, and studying culture and religion. Many beautiful outdoor parks also. \n\nFYI I happen to like the meter gauge railroad trip from Coimbatore to Ooty... actually have to switch trains in between, to connect to meter gauge train going up the mountain....and you can see them engage the cogwheel going up the grading to the Niligiri tea plantation areas around Ooty. \n\nBTW, between Delhi and Mumbai, if you have the time, take the Mumbai Rajdhani Express Train instead of the airplane.  It's and experience... particularly in AC first class sleeper car..... nothing like Amtrak. You can also take the Gharib Rath Express Train. \n\nAlso, the Southernmost point of mainland India on Cape Comorin lies a hamlet called Ashramam in Kanyakumari District of Tamil Nadu (Kerala border). That is my father's native place as they call it in India (place where my father's family originates from)... beautiful place where the Indian Ocean, Arabian Sea, and Bay of Bengal meet.",
      "Beautiful places.i like the tours .ninja nah sry.",
      "Great video",

I sold books to used bookshops , because everyone shops too much for their books. I brought DJ friends to low key himalaya parties.. I even tried my hand at detective work for fun.

Dogs are at the mercy of (who);to feed them. They just eat from piles of garbage- even the cows are eating garbage. This is a huge issue for me in this lifetime. Seeing animal abuse and neglect wreak havoc on my heart. My emotions just well up inside me and burst like a gusher. I’ve even talked to my therapist about this, it is a physical pain that washes over me when I see this kind of thing. Waaaaaaayyyyy to empathetic.

Anyway I didn't really remember it much, I didn't remember anything actually haha I just know what there is to know about my religion, Hinduism, my parents have taught me all they know but I didn't really get to experience the live culture until this past summer. I went to India after 13 years, and my reactions were exactly the same as yours. I went to north and south India. In the north I stayed mainly in Lucknow and New Delhi, then in south India I went to Chennai. I also went to Lumbini, Nepal, where Buddha was born. I saw the Indian and Nepal border. I visited my extended family after like 13 years. Even though I didn't have memories with them it was very easy to get along and enjoy because blood is just blood, I am also fluent in Hindi so that made everything easier. My first few days sucked but I got used to their lifestyle. I don't look Indian, somehow cuz I'm 100% Indian, but yeah people were ripping me off as well. I was also surprised seeing dogs everywhere, I felt so bad but that's just how it is in India lol there are cute homeless dogs everywhere. You brought back so many amazing memories from my trip to India! I miss it like crazy, I was there for one month and it was the best experience of my life. I learned so much and I traveled, met new people, saw different lifestyles, experienced my culture and religion, it was just an amazing experience and I came to realize multiple things, one being seeing how privileged we really are in America. I also HATED the bathrooms there haha the toilet seat was ALWYAS wet after your shower because there isn't anything that separates the toilet from the shower. No tp didn't take long to get used it, their version is way cleaner lol. The electricity went on and off. Haha anyway street shopping is awesome in India, because everything is so cheap. I hope you don't forget to street shop! Make sure you bargain (I had skilled aunties who I went shopping with and always got amazing deals on clothes and accessories, like I would get amazing stuff which in American dollars would cost maybe $2 lol nice shoes, sandals, heels, stylish clothing (maybe not branded but hey looks nice!) ).

This is the second death.” (Revelation 21:8) Probably you are one of those list or maybe all. But good news there is a solution to the problem, JESUS is the solution. \" For GOD so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whoever believes in him will not die but have eternal life.\" (John 3:16), \"I (JESUS) am the WAY, the TRUTH and the LIFE, NO ONE comes to the Father except through me.\" (John 14:6). Jesus is the Son of God. He is the saviour of the world. He died for your sins, he was buried but 3 days later he rose from the dead because he is the GOD. He loves you and want to be with you forever and ever. Repent (Change, Surrender, Hate the SIN) and Believe (Trust, Faithful) in the LORD JESUS CHRIST and you will be saved. Friend, the LORD JESUS changed my life. He set me free and he continues to build and transform me. This is world is full of deception, sin, corruption, hate, killing, gossips, etc. I thought there is no hope in this world until I encounter JESUS. He is real and he loves you. Surrender your life to him. May the Holy Spirit touch your heart and mind.",

Sounds crazy and superstitious? I would think so tpp, but i swear my eye opened when i saw that the influence of these planetary energies are everywhere! For example if u have a chilly in your plate while eating, it depics the energy or Mars, if you tend u waste food , it depicts Rahu,, if you feed crows and dogs or donate to your servants, it recharges your Saturn..crazy",
