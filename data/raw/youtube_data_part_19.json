      "Just a little extra midweek video, decided to do a stripped back vlog so you can see the real Mumbai, hopefully it’s interesting even though it’s not exactly my usual style video. Back to the usual videos on Sunday, £100 in India, and then that’s the end of the Asia videos, back to the UK/Europe videos from then on! Greggs anyone?",
      "Great video well done loved seeing India from your side 😂.",
      "Big Ben is the name of the largest bell in Elizabeth tower",
      "Ewww.. Gross People, gross country 🤮",
      "Ed. You stand out with your hair colour.  That's probably why you got so much attention.  They knew you weren't Indian.   Good video , and like you say some great architecture.",
      "Hi Ed, I normally watch these videos with my Fiancè through his account but I also follow you. I just want to say this series really moved me how wonderful the people were there even though they had very little they still gave their time to you. Thank you for sharing this video. All the best. X",
      "Brings back memories. Been a few times,  had an amazing NYE experience there as well in one of the high rise clubs. The madness is what makes Mumbai.",
      "I couldn’t cope I hate noise and crowds and chaos lol plus it seems like every single person is Just trying to exhort money out of you I’d find that intimidating. There’s no way that “friend” took you on a guided tour and never expected anything in return. They only seem friendly when they want your money",
      "Let's Go India 🇮🇳🎉❤ Assemble Here",
      "Went to Morocco recently. Craziest place I’ve ever been. Something different everywhere I looked. Friendly as people was I got a bit bored of trying to get dragged into shops",
      "Look at all the shite on the ground 😂",
      "Say Mum Bi to heterosexuality 😂",
      "Enjoyed this one. Personally I prefer longer videos so feel free! ❤😂",
      "I went to Kerala (south india) for the first time this January it is so beautiful and calm and everyone’s super friendly, it’s mostly country side and clean and not as busy. I’d love to visit the north at some point too. Deffo recommend you visit there if you’re travelling around India. Great video as always ❤",
      "3:42 Auto-rickshaws (\"Tuk Tuks\" as you say) are famously not allowed in South Mumbai. It makes the traffic slightly nicer compared to other places in India.",
      "1:35 That is the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel, known as just the \"The Taj\", because it was the ever first Taj Hotel. You can get a proper afternoon tea there, but you went to some random other place in your last video. That is also the site of the heinous 26/11 attacks by Pakistani  terrorists.",
      "What a horrible looking place and everyone just wants your money not your friends.",
      "Mumbai has combination of two worlds 1st world n 3rd world...again the average mumbai in Dharavi slums earn better they have their own fridge,Tv ,AC inside their small house.... waiting for the mumbais slum redevelopment project this going to be  a big transition to Mumbai \n\nLess 5 percentage of india live in city  rest of the India has village n lots of beautiful landscapes almost 70 percentage of India has natural landscapes which looks diverse n very few live there all Population live inside city",
      "Try visiting goa , kerala and pondicherry",
      "I'd be there for five minutes before losing my mind.  There's just no way.",
      "Mumbai looks amazing.",
      "Another great video Ed…top quality entertainment as usual.",
      "Go China and compare it.",
      "Please don't land in Mumbai and make an assessment of India based on that godforsaken place 😢",
      "Mumbai is totally getting fucked up by immigrants and peacefuls\nBoth dont got any civic sense",
      "Rather you than me would rather chop a leg off than go to India.",
      "Great video. That local guy was a legend",
      "I loved this, the documentary style was perfect!",
      "Its a huge city with all classes of people. It has the 5 th largest stock exchange in the world. But its very chaotic.  Come to Pune city , a smaller but nicer city.",
      "Holy shit he went to India, let's all pray for the poor guy",
      "So far you're video is reminding me of Charlie Chaplin. Still waiting for you to offer us something great in videos",
      "The blue shirt you have bought isnt football Shirt \nThats the shirt of Cricket sport 😂",
      "🎉Warm welcome bro to india mumbai city keep enjoy beautiful places🎉",
      "Its an indian cricket top not a football top 😂",
      "Sorry but these are old british buildings in Mumbai. 😂 I mean it's fine since these buildings still require maintenance from Municipal corporation, so u can give credit. But still You should visit Navi Mumbai,  pune or Nashik to see modern as well as Hindu architecture and buildings.",
      "There’s a rumour about the station in Mumbai and Melbourne.  The rumour is that the plans were accidentally mixed up and Mumbai got Melbourne’s station and Melbourne got Mumbai’s station.",
      "Another great video...it was nice of the bloke to show you around and didn't want anything......it's very busy place..bit upsetting with all the animals in small cages....it was funny being sticked up thinking it was a football top and it was a cricket one 😂😂",
      "I had to wait until i finished my dinner before i clicked on this video. 🤣",
      "This might be one of my favourite videos of yours. It was great seeing you just wandering round and interacting with folk naturally; with your personality shining through. More like this!",
      "I don't agree with ripping us off if they come to England we charge them same as everyone else. And India is not poor they have a space programme for God's sake and still   lots of countries send them foreign aid",
      "How much did the tour guide demand? Everyone in India is after your money",
      "Modelled on Big Ben by someone who had never seen it, I assume",
      "Great vid Ed! It's so good to see how much your confidence has grown over the years! Solo travelling has done you a world of good! 🌍 ❤",
      "Those poor animals I didn’t like that but at all",
      "Wow india is nice. Just a bit to choastic. They will definitely resolve this issue in next 10 years. So marks my words i will visit india in 2035. As a female",
      "Comment section is full with foreign tiktok professor with zero education",
      "It's just like London 2025.",
      "You will never get bored and depressed in India",
      "Massive shithole and I don't really understand why anyone wants to visit.",
      "If they have not nicknamed the clock tower 'Big Benji' I will be hugely unimpressed.",
      "why the hell would anybody go to India.. its like paying good money to experience cancer..",
      "Ooops stepped in human shit.",
      "This was a really great Video, Ed! With all due respect to India and Indians in general,  the 'real' Mumbai looks like a hell hole of chaos, litter and pollution. Not somewhere I'd feel comfortable visiting. Seeing those animals in cages at the market was also not very nice to see. It's still very much a third world country/city.\n\nKeep up the good work, Ed. You go and visit places a lot of us wouldn't feel comfortable going to.",
      "I bet ed got the shits",
      "It’s cricket !! What gave it away ? The fact there’s a guy bowling a cricket ball on the right(left watching it on tv)  side of the chest or something else 😂",
      "Just when I thought I could t love you more Ed. What a wonderfully beautiful caring video ❤",
      "Lovely video. I like the 'real' aspect to your trips as much as the 'trying British food' and the general chaos and sarcasm.",
      "I think the Victorians were very cognisant of making sure their buildings were built in the style of Harry Potter, for future generations to admire.",
      "Glad to see you enjoyed yourself, but it’s certainly not a place I will ever visit.",
      "That large building you were questioning was the location for a crazy attack 2008. 31 people perished in that building and 175 in total across various locations.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_Mumbai_attacks",
      "It’s always the people you meet along the journey that make it memorable",
      "Many of these buildings were built during the British Raj so they were designed by Brits and so that victorian architecture is there. Though there are many modern buildings in mumbai design and build for india like Taj hotel & many other places but remember Mumbai is a new city(especially central region)..it was a collection of islands upon which modern day mumbai was mostly constructed, during British Raj so it doesn't have as many ancient Indian buildings or even Maratha Buildings cause back then there was no Mumbai (as we know it today but swam & islands were there with local communities) so if you want to see indian architecture you have to move out of Mumbai city and go to nearby islands or lil into countryside (50-90km will do). Like alorra caves or maratha fords or local house which are there for decades",

      "People to friendly, I would run 🏃‍♂️ 😅",
      "A huge part of south Mumbai was built by the British. Almost all of those old pretty buildings were built by them. There's a bit more modern part of town in central, and the suburbs, but perhaps less touristy stuff to do. \n\nYou could not find any tuktuks because they're not allowed in Mumbai town. Only in the suburbs. \n\n\nAwesome video, Ed!",

      "Oh what a glorious city. Thanks Ed, this type of vlog is so interesting, I'd like to see more like this, behind the scenes real life.",
      "Locals chatting to you, being super friendly and acting like a tour guide and saying they want to practice their English is a local scam. Eventually they try and get you to buy something. Similar thing happens in neighbouring Nepal\n\nIve had them take me round for 1hr before doing the hard sell or want a tip",
      "Crawford market is hell for animals and run by unethical illegal breeders looking to sell animals kept in the most pitiful conditions to make a quick buck.",

      "An Ed Chapman upload on a Thursday? Sacrilege",

      "That clock tower is obviously modelled on Rochdale town hall :D",
      "Couldn’t pay me to go there",
      "1:35 That is a hotel! It's India's version of the Ritz, in the sense that it's their most famous old ultra luxury hotel. It's called the Taj Mahal Palace and they're known for their afternoon tea! (It's also where I assumed you were going to do your Afternoon in the last video).",
      "That animal section has really upset me to see 😢 why don’t they atleast give them blankets to sleep on, not a cage floor that is lined metal sections with gaps :( so cruel…. 😢",

      "Looks like Northampton to be honest.....\nStill better than Rugby or Brum 🤷‍♂️",
      "Every building you loved was built by the British themselves, not the modern government 😂",
      "Really appreciate the effort you put into keeping it sensitive and respectful. Love the light hearted stuff but this showcased the place itself rather than you in a place",
