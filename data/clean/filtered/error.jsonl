{"comment": "Bro said that the children were harassing her but honestly at the part where she was talking to thoes two children where one pushed the other boy on her and ran away , honestly i have experienced this but the differences was that I was the victim there i mean like I was pushed on a teacher by friend  who ran away the second the teacher turned as i was only like 7 to 8 yrs old so i didn't get in trouble  and I agree that India is not that much safe for women \" in some areas\" its just that she is a   foreign  thats why everybody r staring her If u observe clearly u can see that not \"only men but\" other's r staring too and bro seriously how can you say a 7 - 9 yrs old kid is trying to touch that  woman who is nearly his mother's age  have u seen his face was! But the child who pushed him deserves the scolding though. But the children who r at her back for money i don't encourage that too but what can we do but they r said to do them if they don't they  don't get to eat . But i don't think that you an creat such rumors abt them right cuz 1 or 2 people can't say abt whole country right .", "language": "english"}
